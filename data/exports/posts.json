This means I know what equivalent jobs should pay, and know what I want to earn.\n\n  \nThere's a ton of advice online about never naming the first number in a negotiation, and pushing the company to name a range. This just seems like picking a fight for the sake of it or annoying the company at offer stage.\n\n  \nHere's what I do:\n\n  \n\\- If the company names a range, I pick a number near the top of it (usually 5k under). That's their budget, and it makes me look less greedy than asking for the top.\n\n  \n\\- If the company doesn't name a range, in my cover letter or the application form I name a number - not a range, a specific number, saying I'm seeking that salary. The company can either interview me at that salary or reject me for wanting too much.\n\n  \nEveryone saves a lot of time. There's no negotiation.\n\n  \n",

    "selftext": "People really need to understand the difference between “this is bad” and “I don’t like this.” It feels like a lot of people forget that personal taste exists. When it comes to music, movies, TV shows, whatever, people jump straight to saying something is trash instead of just admitting it’s not for them.\n\nThere’s a big difference between something actually being poorly made and something just not fitting your preferences. I saw a comment the other day where someone said they’ve never heard a good rap album. Someone suggested To Pimp a Butterfly, and the person replied that they tried it and it was “bad.” Like bro, come on. By almost any reasonable metric, that album is not “bad.” They just didn’t like it, and that’s totally fine, but acting like your taste is the objective truth is ridiculous.\n\nThe same thing happens with food. People say stuff like “French food is bad” or “that cuisine is bad.” Really? Every single dish from an entire cuisine is just objectively terrible? Or do you just not like those flavours or it doesn't fit your taste palate?\n\nObviously some things are actually poorly done, whether it’s food or media, and I’m not talking about that. I’m talking about people who treat their personal preferences like they’re universal facts. It’s okay to dislike something, just be honest that it’s your taste and not some objective statement about quality. I think it shows a lot of intelligence and nuance if someone is able to identify something as good quality but realises it just doesn't fit their taste. ",

    "selftext": "I take the metro daily in a large city (top 3) in the US as a student working on my training. I recently noticed that as a brown guy, people are almost openly racist on the metro. I dress very, very modestly, mind my own business, and treat everyone with respect. I am an Indian and adult male in mid 20s.\n\nIn the past few days, I’ve faced several instances of racism I’d only ever read about in books. I understand that there is a sentiment that people from my country “take American jobs,” but this is not entirely true. I work in a subfield where the only Americans working are Asians who are now naturalized citizens or the ones who were born here. This has directly affected my work and my company’s output.\n\nTo describe the incidents: people saying things like “I’ll chop you up,” “Get off my streets,” “You don’t belong here,” “You are not welcome,” people making faces as direct disrespect and frowning at you because of who you are, just to intimidate you. People endlessly staring as if they’re screaming inside, “Why the fk are you here?” I seriously considered leaving the country a couple of times, but I can’t, because I’m important to my job and my work matters.\n\nApart from this, a person in a wheelchair ran behind me with a knife, and a lady with clear mental health issues was throwing things at another Indian guy (my friend sitting behind me), seemingly just because he is Indian. I’m now planning to buy a car, but I keep wondering: if this is what happens on the metro — which has cameras, security personnel occasionally present, emergency buttons and doors, and other people around — then what about places where you don’t have such protections?\n\nI know not everyone here is like this, and I’ve also met kind people, but this has really shaken my sense of safety and belonging.\nIf anyone has been through something similar, how did you cope, and what helped you feel safer without completely giving up on living your life?",

    "title": "Why is it that Christians who are darker-complexioned depict Christ as having the whitest skin?",
    "selftext": "Indian Christians claim that they've been Christians since around 4 AD. Some even say that it was around the dawn of the 4th Century AD - which means in the early 300s AD. However, today they have British, Greek, and sometimes Aramaic names. Other ancient Christian communities from Armenia, Georgia, Ethiopia, and Palestine have names like \"Ashrawi\", \"Abebe\", \"Basmadjian\", and \"Dzugashvili.\" None of these Christian surnames are Greek, Aramaic, or English like they do in Kerala, India.\n\nThe Kerala-based Christians [worship at churches with British architecture and European esthetics - even the Jesus looks very white.](https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=10222277610487719&amp;set=gm.2617233658664410&amp;idorvanity=2181129945608119) \n\n[Another people who depict a Nordic Jesus are Nigerians who also are another ancient community of Christians.](https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/2022-06-07T093558Z_1947825116_RC2CMU9PDVL2_RTRMADP_3_NIGERIA-SECURITY.jpg?resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80)\n\nThe Koreans have first practiced Christianity in 1784, but these Christians, who were Catholic, faced severe persecution. Around 1880, Christianity was reintroduced by Protestant missionaries from Manchuria, and it really picked up during their Japanese occupation. [In their depictions of Biblical events, they clearly show Jesus as someone having Eastern Asian features](https://www.churchpop.com/content/images/wordpress/2015/06/5.jpg). It's remarkable to me that most people would find this peculiar and not historically accurate, but then again, neither is the European's depiction of Jesus having European features. \n\n[In Italy, they were depicting brown-skinned Jesus since 530 AD.](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/375065475199027614/) \n\nOn the other hand, [the iconography of Jesus inside an Armenian church - literally a place of worship in the Caucuses - is depicted darker than the iconography of a Nordic Jesus at a church in Kerala, India.](https://thumbs.dreamstime.com/b/yerevan-armenia-september-interior-armenian-apostolic-church-yerevan-armenia-altar-iconostas-interior-223347750.jpg?w=576)\n\n[Inside a Georgian church, which is in the Northern Caucuses region of the world, the Caucasian people there depict Jesus with having even darker complexion.](https://wander-lush.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Emily-Lush-Tbilisi-churches-St-Abo-Tbileli-icon.jpg) \n\nIs it racist that Kerala Christians and Ugandan Christians depict a white-skinned Jesus, but their religious counterparts in Italy, Georgia, Palestine, and Armenia all depict Jesus as being much more darker and a lot less European? If so, what can we do about it? What about the Korean's depiction of Jesus?",

    "selftext": "Posted this in another subreddit but figured out this one is a better place for this. \n\nHi everyone. I’m a 20-year-old Indian woman, and I’m honestly scared to even write this here.I don’t know if it’s the world or just the internet lately, but I’ve been feeling this deep, painful sense of shame about my identity...something I’ve never felt before.\n\nI’ve always been confident about who I am. I grew up loving different cultures, making friends from all around the world through exchanges and online communities. Racism was something I always spoke out against, no matter where it came from. I used to believe people were getting kinder and more aware with time. But lately… it feels like the opposite.\n\nThe amount of hatred, mockery, and open xenophobia I see, especially towards Indians lately has been eating away at me. I see people shaming my entire country for the actions of a few, trolling with baseless racist stereotypes,laughing at our pain, even celebrating the deaths of Indians in tragic accidents as some kind of “good news.” I tell myself they’re just trolls, that they don’t represent everyone. But deep down, I don’t know anymore.\n\nWhat’s worse is that now, I find myself hesitating to even mention where I’m from. I dodge questions about my culture. I avoid talking about festivals, food, or anything that might “reveal” me. And the most heartbreaking part? I’ve started feeling embarrassed about something I used to be proud of.\n\nI'm told I don’t look stereotypically \"Indian” whatever that means.I guess there is a western belief that all Indians are dark skinned. Neither do I have that infamous Indian accent. Most of us don't actually. I never thought I'd say this but sometimes I feel relieved internally.\n\nI find myself wanting to hide my background.I catch myself thinking - would people treat me differently if they knew? I feel scared and have started actually feeling inferior to everyone. I hide it well.. I still interact with people from different countries and foreign delegates and thankfully nothing as such has happened to my face.\n\nI know every country, every culture has its flaws. I’ve never denied mine. I’ve always focused on the beauty that every culture holds. And yet… lately it feels like being Indian automatically puts me on the wrong side of the world’s judgment.\n\nMy mental health hasn’t been great. Some days I wake up and genuinely wonder if I somehow deserve this. If being born Indian is something I should feel guilty for. And then I hate myself for even thinking that. Sometimes I even wish I was from a different race or culture these days. As if I'm not worth any love or basic respect and dignity.\n\nIt’s a strange, suffocating kind of pain...to love the world so much, to love people and their cultures, and then suddenly feel like the world doesn’t want to love you back.\n\nI don’t know...maybe I just needed to say it somewhere. I’d really love to hear from others who’ve felt something similar, no matter where you’re from. Maybe it’ll remind me that the world still has good people in it.",

I understand completely. \n\nYesterday, I think I saw a post by him in Unsentlettersraw when I wrote one to say I did love him still and I missed him. It was written 30mins after mine where he said he couldn't be a therapist, a personal Uber, a bank account, etc. \n\nI am working on myself with DBT skills, I have booked 2 therapy appointments (I have been in therapy for years now but the focus has been on grief from my mom passing recently the last 2yrs) but now I feel terrible and horrible because I never knew he felt that way. I have to make up the money to him and the time, so i will be sending more money (i already sent some). I have been feeling maybe it would be easier to end it all just so he could get my life insurance money since it sounds like he hates me completely, and then I could rest assured that he got the money he wishes for back. Maybe I am spiraling and thinking this random person is him. I just feel like garbage and it sounded like me exactly since April, when I struggled to land a job. And when I felt like an inconvenience to ask to practice driving to get my license. \n\nI know I was the problem; I am taking DBT seriously (doing it everyday/practicing my skills for hours) and trying to change myself because I am a monster. I wish I knew he felt this way during the relationship... I wouldn't have asked for rides. I always felt bad about it, even though I could get annoyed when he didn't. I know that was manipulative of me ans abusive of me. I am working so hard on it the last week or more. \n\nSorry for the long post. I just feel like I can never make it up to him.",

    "selftext": "There’s a post on the Royal Mail subreddit where someone posted gifts someone had left out, drinks and food and rather than appreciate it they’re bloody moaning saying ‘suppose this makes up for being underpaid and heavily overworked.’\n\nIt’s not the persons fault you’re in a shit job or one you hate. If anything a little niceness would make your day rather than making you miserable. Surely if your job is making you that miserable rather than complain about it why don’t you at least try and find another job?\n\nI’ve noticed it in other areas not just that post. You can do something small to try and make someone’s day and some people just aren’t appreciative or make it all about misery or try to make you feel like shit cos they feel like shit.\n\nETA: I am not talking about people who do nice or kind things just to look good. I am on about people just being nice or kind in general without an ulterior motive. You know, people just being generally decent. ",

    "selftext": "With that, r/charts is opening up recruiting to get more help.\n\nWhile our mod list shows half a dozen members, just 2 are active, and even myself don't have the time I'd like. Credit to u/EvTheSmev for his work as well in keeping this place going, he is owed a lot more thanks for sure. Applicants should send a mod mail to r/charts following the format below explaining how you fit the criteria. We'd like to hear from you!\n\nTo keep this simple, r/charts is looking for 3 things in potential mods. \n\n**1.** Interest in charts, data, visualizations, and design. You don't have to work in this field, but the only reason you might even be reading this post is because you care about the content of this sub, and we're looking for people with that same passion. With that, tell us why you want to come moderate this sub in the first place.\n\n**2.** Understanding and agree to adhere to reddit rules. This is important because without doing so, this sub cannot exist. We are part of reddit and must agree to all reddit rules that apply to all subs, and as moderators are expected to enforce their rules as well as our own subreddit rules. \n\nI'm including this here so members also understand the kind of enforcement reddit expects and the kinds of content that won't be allowed in the sub (and were never allowed in the sub, per Reddit). Our Rule #1 \"Don't be a dick\" is very much the same as reddit's rule. \n\n*Rule 1: Remember the human. Reddit is a place for creating community and belonging, not for attacking marginalized or vulnerable groups of people. Everyone has a right to use Reddit free of harassment, bullying, and threats of violence. Communities and people that incite violence or that promote hate based on identity or vulnerability will be banned.*\n\nMarginalized or vulnerable groups include, but are not limited to, groups based on their actual and perceived race, color, religion, national origin, ethnicity, immigration status, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, pregnancy, or disability. These include victims of a major violent event and their families. \n\nWhile the rule on hate protects such groups, it does not protect those who promote attacks of hate or who try to hide their hate in bad faith claims of discrimination.\n\nSome examples of hateful activities that would violate the rule:\n\n* Community dedicated to mocking people with physical disabilities. \n* Post describing a racial minority as sub-human and inferior to the racial majority.\n* Comment arguing that rape of women should be acceptable and not a crime.\n* Meme declaring that it is sickening that people of color have the right to vote.\n* Post promoting harmful tropes or generalizations based on religion (e.g. a certain religious group controls the media, or consists entirely of terrorists). \n* A comment denying or minimizing the scale of a hate-based violent event. \n\n[https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360045715951-Promoting-Hate-Based-on-Identity-or-Vulnerability](https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360045715951-Promoting-Hate-Based-on-Identity-or-Vulnerability)\n\n**3.** Experience moderating. This could be on reddit, Meta, or anywhere else. It's not required but we'd be interested in hearing what experience you have in moderating and how you approach it. One of the biggest challenges to moderation is given enough rules there's always something you may not think is a \"big deal\" but would still be expected to enforce. Or the user is somebody who posts content you frequently agree with - but their post is problematic and violates one of the sub or reddit rules. \n\nGreat, now burying the lede, we'd also like members help in discussing the types of content that should and shouldn't be on r/charts. While I appreciate reddit a lot for being a place for open communication, we also aren't interested in charts that use fake or misleading data, or presented disingenuously (dishonestly) to push narratives. We see this most often with both political and racial charts -  and would like comments on whether we limit that type of content as a whole or my hope is with better moderation we'll be able to be more selective about content that's created in good faith.\n\nOne thing I'd like to consider doing is modifying the spam rule to #1 increase the amount of self-promotion - if people work in data visualizations etc. this should be the place where you're allowed to show off your own work #2 add political content, crime statistics, etc. to the spam rule. Which would mean \"ideological\" redditors who only post crime statistics in the UK would need to vary their content or their posts would be considered spam. I don't want to ban this kind of content outright but also don't want the whole front page of r/charts clogged with these types of posts. We'd like your feedback and how you think we should approach it.\n\nThanks all, appreciate you taking the time reading this and look forward to hearing from people interested in joining the r/charts mod team!",

You know how it goes. Make a whole build out of one cool part. Receiver set you like. Need one for home defense, a sniper, SBR, spicy trigger, 5.56 .300BLK .450 Bushmaster 6mm ARC 6.5 Grendel 5.7x28 .410, ultralight carbon fiber, AR-10's in .308, 6.5 Creed and 8.6 BLK... I kinda went off the rails for a bit there.   \nI'm looking to get rid of all but a few. I know I'll never recoup what I put into them, and the stores rob you and they don't want to buy non-branded rifles regardless of the parts and quality. Consignment takes a big cut if they'll even do it. Auctions are sketchy. And I live in Colorado so private sales are a pain in the ass!! Can't sell all of them to my family.    \nI have parts to \"unstamp\" my SBR's if needed. Don't know if I could take them to a gun show and sell there. We have a few big ones throughout the year but again that 72 hour wait is killing me. Don't know what/if they'd charge me for a table or just stick a For Sale flag in the barrel. I guess I could disassemble some of them and sell them for parts, but apart from a few trash panda builds most of mine are really good. I'd hate to strip them down.   \n\n\ntl;dr - I have too many guns and I can't get rid of them!!\n\n\n\nP.S. I know. I know. \"There's no such thing as too many guns\" but I have at least 3 that have never been fired, and the ones that have been through test n tune I barely take out. Some of the odd calibers are expensive to feed. All hanging out at home in my basement doing nothing but posting pictures on the internet. I'd like to see them move out of the house and get a real job!!",

Otherwise, I would not have gone. Frankly, I hate Thanksgiving, so I just do whatever would be best for my child and tough the rest.\n\nSo... I still feel like this is probably a better sub than an epilepsy one for understanding around this because it isn't *really* about seizures at its core, but there have been a few times in my 38 years that I have been unable to drive due to seizures not being under control. One of these times started a bit over two years ago. I've been able to drive for a while now, but this time I became anxious about it.\n\nSo... To get to my family Member's house, I had to go through Dallas, Tx. I live in a small town, and I really haven't driven further than 30ish miles from home since I was not allowed to drive. So... No more than a 4-lane highway with pretty much no traffic. I just keep letting my husband drive and haven't had a reason to drive further.\n\nI could have let my husband drive, but because of the particular way Thanksgiving with extended family is emotionally tough for me, I decided I NEEDED to do this. I needed to feel like a **capable adult** that day because I don't always get treated like one.\n\nWell, I halfway thought I was going to stop off somewhere before Dallas and switch with my husband. 😂 Before I could do that, I realized I was headed through downtown Dallas.\n\nI started bawling. I'm so grateful to have a husband who understood exactly why I was blubbering. I wasn't anxious. I was just so happy, proud of myself, and grateful that I'm medically allowed to drive again and I finally worked up the courage to do it through a big city. Like, I was DOING IT and I wasn't even anxious. My brain wasn't overwhelmed-- I was navigating it. It's like... I know I have driven through cities many times in the past, but after this last time with my seizures coming back I lost so much confidence, and my extended family isn't always helpful for me believing I am a capable person.\n\nSince my husband is the only person in my life who gets it, I wanted to share here and see if anyone else understands. ❤️ I was so happy, and so many people wouldn't be able to understand to celebrate with me. I am really needing even more proof of me being a capable and worthwhile person this holiday season.",

Some background I've got enough credits to equal an associate's degree. I was in a pretty rough relationship with someone who really tore down my self-esteem and self worth, and made me feel as if I'll never amount to his greatness or just be a shadow to him. I won't get into it since it's not the point of this post, but I feel like me joining the AF would make or break this relationship I had with him. \n* I want to join for the schooling benefits too to complete my bachelor's at a college. Hopefully be done with bachelor's before I get out in the 4 years I plan to enlist for. My family life is good for the most part, I find myself being a bit depressed because I feel like an outcast in terms of uprooting my life for the relationship I was in and leaving my family behind because I moved far away to be with him. My parents are divorced, and it still affects me to this day, and I just don't like living in the memories of it because I feel like a constant cushion for my parents' emotions about it. My parents don't get along, and I'm often used as a way to help them communicate. I hate it. I feel like a failure and a bit angry at myself, but I'm lacking structure because I've been so broken down. I want my family to feel proud of me and be proud of myself. I'm not social, I don't go out and don't have any friends, I'm just a shell.\n* My brother is in the Marines. He's 20 and graduated bootcamp in Nov 2024, I'm so proud of him and recently visited him in Camp Pendelton. He was in an even worse state than me before he left for Marines, but I've noticed he's a lot more structured and has a great head on his shoulders now.\n\nI guess I'm seeing the AF as a way to run away and build myself up again. To make good friends, get my skills up and use the benefits to better myself so I can get myself back.\n\nThe things I can pinpoint holding me back are:\n\n* Homesickness but probably temporary.\n* The relationship I had that I'm still clinging to mentally, because it was a huge part of my life, and we've thought about getting back together to make it work.\n* Possible regret in the beginning, thinking I made a mistake and that it's not my answer like I strongly believe it is now. (I feel like after the 8.5 weeks of bootcamp are the only thing that's holding me back.)",

    "selftext": "I (18F) went to school with this guy (21M) a couple of years ago before he moved away and changed schools. While we were both in school, we became friends pretty quickly and shared a friend group and fun times. But there were a few red flags that I started noticing that made me want to distance myself from him. For example, he mentioned once that he pretended to be gay in order to get close to the girl he liked so he could date her. He also would make me uncomfortable by always saying \"te amo\" to me, which means I love you in spanish, claiming he was just practicing his spanish. But eventually I took some distance and  he moved away and I just continued with my life. I didn't hate him or cut him off at all, but we were definetly not as close anymore.\n\nFast forward to this year. He has moved back from the US and now he is studying in uni. He is still friends with some of my friends, so I know about his life through them (and his instagram stories). They have told me that he lives alone in the city and has a long distance girlfriend from the US. He also has said that he doesn't have any friends from uni and that he only meets up with a few of his old high school friends, but that he is a bit lonely. I have also somewhat remained in contact with him, as he would sometimes reply to my story, and we would text a bit because of that, but never met up.\n\nOne day, he replied to my story after posting that I had gone to see Revenge of the Sith in theatres and suggested meeting up to have a Star Wars marathon. I said yes but we ended up never planning it. However, a couple months later he asked again, and I said yes again thinking it would also come to nothing. But instead, we ended up actually planning it. Though i didn't want to go, I figured it would be a one time thing to help him feel better and give him some company. I also thought things wouldn't be too weird (like with the \"te amo\" stuff) because he had a girlfriend. I even invited our mutual friend to join us so I wouldn't be alone, but she ended up being busy that day so she couldn't make it.\n\nSo we met up at his house, watched the first movie, talked for a bit and then I went home. It was super awkward because we hadn't seen each other in forever, and I was very uncomfortable the whole time, especially when I found out that he broke up with his girlfriend. But I left feeling glad I could give him some company and lift his spirits, but I did not intend on hanging out with him again.\n\nHe texted me a couple days ago to plan our next hangout and I ghosted him for a few days, and then told him I didn't have time. I barely have time to go out these days because of my work schedule and I don't want to reestablish a connection with him because he continues to make me uncomfortable, but I feel bad for ignoring him... Am i in the wrong?",

I can’t even stay focused at work I just find myself crying in the porta potty, I’ve just pushed everyone else away from my life too I think I deserve to feel this way, I’ll no matter what regret the things I didn’t do for the rest of my life I just want to know do you guys ever learn to deal with the pain",

    "selftext": "We have two elder cats (16M and 17F) and they both have a slew of health complications. We're having a hard time figuring out when it's time to put them down.\n\nOne is a renal boy, maine coon mix, managing most of his other issues—hyperthyroidism, gall stones, eye stuff, heart murmur—so really his problem is he's wasting away. Ever since switching to a renal diet, he's been progressively skinnier. He's—I'm afraid to say it—5.4lbs now and it's only going in one direction. BUT! He's still hungry (he hates his food.) he's mobile, grooms himself (not great), he uses the litter box (he makes a ton of mistakes but it's always been the case with his gall stones), he still cuddles (although it's always been hunger-related) and shows interest in going outside. He takes fluids, stool softeners, phosphate inhibitors daily. He's always been a tough cat, but I don't want to mistake his stoicness with a desire to keep living. We know it's a personal thing, but want to hear people's thoughts.\n\nThe girl, a tabby american shorthair mix, is also renal, not yet on fluids, but we gave her some the other day cause she's now drinking all day. She's always been a very healthy cat unlike her brother, but she's grown a massive mammary tumor over the last 2 years. Our vets never talk about it because it's inoperable-she's too old for surgery—but we know that it will eventually get in the way of her other organs functioning (it's apparently not spreading to other organs, just three ping pong size growths on her chest.) Recently, she's shown downs of slowing down. Stairs are getting really hard for her, but, like her brother, if we go just by the regular quality of life assessment—Pain, Mobility, Appetite, Hygiene, Interest, Breathing, or HHHHHHMM (Hurt, Hunger, Hydration, Hygiene, Happiness, Mobility, More Good Days Than Bad)—I'd say she's doing alright for a cat in her condition. Mobility maybe is an issue for her, but that's it. She's not bedridden.\n\nBehaviorally, they both drink more, but neither of them is hiding, they're just making many more litter box errors. They still come to us. We're so grateful for their many years of love, we just want to know whether people put down cats that just won't see better days and want to avoid seeing them wasting away. The cost is an issue, but primarily is that we don't want to do wrong by these friends of ours. ",

    "selftext": "I want to know your opinions on Will and his powers. \n\nIf we go by the first shadow, which the Duffers appear to be doing, Henry gained his powers after going to Dimension X through the Nevada Caves and getting infected with mind flayer particles. His blood became different and the mind flayer started to corrupt him. \n\nSomething very similar happened to Will, he was also taken to the other side and when he came back he had gained True Sight. He then was fully taken by the Mind Flayer on the football field. \n\nDr Owens kept checking on Will and drawing blood to see if he had gone the same changes as Vecna’s but nothing seemed to be different, besides the True Sight. \n\nNow, after accepting he had the strength inside of him all along by listening to Robin’s  (&lt;333) words he was able to defeat the Demogorgons. \n\nNow what I’m wondering is what is the source of his powers. One very common and incredibly annoying trope is “protagonist gains powers from the villain, defeats the villain and loses his powers” like Harry Potter losing parseltongue after defeating Voldy. I absolutely hate this. The way I see it once they take it, it should be theirs. \n\nSo I’m thinking maybe Will has had abilities all along season season 1/2 but had no self esteem or belief in himself. I mean Noah said it himself, Will was the most stepped on kid of the whole show. But now thanks to Robin’s words he found the strength to use his abilities and then he connected to the hive mind to reach far away with his abilities and kill all demogorgons. \n\nThe other possibility that I’ve seen some people mention is that he has no actual power, but is connected to Vecna and the Hive Mind, and that on the last scene he was using the connection and Vecna’s powers to kill the Demogorgons. \n\nNoah has said in an interview to Variety that he had an acting coach to help him figure it out how to show him developing his abilities on the show, so I’m guessing he can do more than just connect to the hive mind and kill creatures a lá Vecna. \n\nWhat do you guys think? Do you want will to have his own abilities or just share in Vecna’s? \n\nAfter everything he’s been through I want him to keep his abilities after they defeat Vecna and seal the Upside down. Otherwise he’s just gonna lose them after a couple of days and become a “regular” person again just extremely traumatized.",

    "selftext": "All forms of violence should be classified as attempted murder and prosecuted at the highest degree.\n\nWhy? Because the current system treats violence like it comes in “cute little tiers.” Assault, battery, misdemeanor, felony, yada yada. Meanwhile the reality is simple:\nWhen you choose to inflict violence on someone, you’re gambling with their life. You don’t get to precisely engineer the outcome of a punch, shove, kick, or choke. People die from one-punch hits all the time. People get brain damage from “just a slap.” Falls can kill. Freak injuries happen. Intent doesn’t magically prevent irreversible consequences.\n\nSo yeah—if you decide to put your hands on another human being, you’ve already crossed a line into behavior that can kill someone, even if you were too stupid, emotional, or reckless to think it through.\n\nThe current legal system gives violent people a safety net.\n“Relax bro, it’s only a misdemeanor assault.”\nCool—tell that to someone who hits their head on concrete and never wakes up.\n\nClassifying all intentional violence as attempted murder would do three things:\n\n1. Remove the incentive to ‘test the waters.’ If all violence is treated as life-threatening, maybe people will stop acting like they can clock someone in the jaw without consequences.\n\n\n2. Put responsibility back where it belongs. If you throw a punch, you’re accepting the risk that the outcome could be fatal. You don’t get to shrug that off.\n\n\n3. Stop the moral gymnastics. The moment you decide “I want to hurt this person,” you are demonstrating a willingness to cause severe physical harm. Whether the victim dies or not is often luck, not skill.\n\n\n\nWe already treat drunk driving this way—you didn’t mean to kill anyone, but you created a situation where death is a very real possibility, so the law brings the hammer down. Violence should be the same.\n\nIf society is serious about reducing violent behavior, then stop sugar-coating it.\nViolence isn’t “just a punch.” It’s a coin flip with someone else’s life.",

    "title": "Climat social au Québec: perspective d'un immigrant",
    "selftext": "Salut tout le monde!\n\nEn ce samedi matin, j’aimerais lancer une discussion sur le climat politique et social actuel au Québec et offrir ma perspective en tant qu’immigrant. Pour le contexte, je suis arrivé au Québec vers la fin des années 2000 avec ma famille, et je dirais que je suis très imprégné de la culture québécoise. Pourtant, depuis quelques années, je ressens un véritable malaise face au discours qui se tient sur l’immigration au Québec.\n\nÇa m’a fait beaucoup de bien de lire le témoignage de Kim Thúy, qui mettait parfaitement le doigt sur ce sentiment. La vague de haine qu’elle a reçue en réaction à ce texte m’a fait prendre conscience du fait que, pour beaucoup, les immigrants restent une classe à part de Québécois, qui n’aurait pas le droit de critiquer la société.\n\nLa fin abrupte du programme PEQ, sans clause de droits acquis, me montre que les immigrants sont perçus comme des chiffres. On ne les voit pas comme des personnes ayant laissé une vie derrière elles, venues offrir des services dont nous avons besoin, sur la promesse qu’elles pourraient s’établir ici, promesse aujourd’hui brisée.\n\nQuand je vois l’effacement graduel des symboles religieux dans l’espace public (soyons honnêtes, on vise surtout le voile) et quand j’entends François Legault parler d’un « assaut de l’islamisme radical sur nos valeurs », j’ai l’impression qu’on cherche à instaurer un climat de peur et d’intolérance au Québec. Rappelons que le seul véritable « assaut radical » des dernières années a été l’attentat à la grande mosquée de Québec. Je trouve irresponsable que la classe politique instrumentalise l’inconfort de certaines personnes face à la religion musulmane, rendant ainsi cette communauté encore plus vulnérable à la haine et à la violence.\n\nJe ne suis pas musulman moi-même, mais comme membre d’une minorité visible, je me sens concerné lorsque des groupes minoritaires sont ciblés. On a d’ailleurs vu pendant la pandémie que même la communauté asiatique, souvent perçue comme une « minorité exemplaire », n’a pas été à l’abri d’une vague de racisme.\n\nBeaucoup de personnes se mettent sur la défensive lorsqu’on aborde le sujet de l’immigration. Non, je ne pense pas que ce soit raciste de penser qu’il faut réduire les seuils d’immigration, mais il faut reconnaître que certains partis politiques parlent constamment de l’immigration de manière négative, notamment en la présentant comme **LA** cause principale de la crise du logement. Le but de ma publication est simplement de montrer que ce qui est perçu comme « protéger nos valeurs » pour certains peut être vécu comme un rejet ou un effacement pour d’autres.\n\nC’était mon 2 cents. Je suis curieux de savoir ce que vous pensez de tout ça.",

    "title": "Wife of 23 years announced intentions to divorce. I am utterly wrecked and worried. My story and help requested",
    "selftext": "My life has been hell since July.  My wife of 23 years has been my entire adult life.  6 months ago I would have said our marriage was solid.\n\nMy wife (let's call her Kat) lost her job in March and had a botched surgery in May.  Both of which hugely impacted her mental health.  I feel her mental health changed her.  She decided she has been a victim and I've been an (emotional) abuser.  I've been struggling to accept that at the same time of learning about an affair she had (see below).\n\nWe had a big argument on July 3rd (first one in awhile).  The therapist she was seeing for her surgery mental health breakdown gave her the emotional abuse sheet.   Over the next week, she admitted having an 18-month affair that ended 13 years ago.  I was severely traumatized.  She held that secret from me for 14 years.  She told me a lot of the graphic details of when and where (i.e., an incident in our own house and bed).  But meanwhile Kat dug further into the emotional abuse thread.  \n\nWe saw some couples counseling in July/August that didn't go great.  Just so much resentment coming out without much guidance from the counselor.\n\nNonetheless we continued to vacation together. To plan new vacations for 2026.  \n\nI continued to struggle with emotions over the affair.  She continued to press me on taking accountability and ownership over emotional abuse.  I tried to do some of that.  I've had a hard time reconciling what is actually \"small trivial crap\" versus \"do I really have a problem?\".  I strongly resisted the label \"emotional abuser\" because when I look at the criteria I haven't done the majority of what is on there.  I admit to some occasional verbal abuse and generally wanting to control/win arguments.  Also my self esteem and worth have been wrecked by the affair.  \n\nA therapist I'm seeing led me further down the \"you are an abuser\" path because turns out his primary career focus fills group therapy sessions for abusive men and I didn't realize that.  They consider an eye roll on the spectrum of domestic violence.  He actually called her, brought her into our last appointment, labeled me an abuser in front of her, told her stuff I revealed to him (about my upbringing) that I felt violated confidentiality, and recommended that intensive program he runs with a huge time commitment.\n\nI resisted this program.  Kat got meaner/angrier as I resisted this over the weeks in November.\n\nI feel the meanness towards me made me more vulnerable and that I was walking on eggshells.   \n\nLast weekend we had a \"last straw\" incident where I wanted to talk to her some more about some recent things she said that I felt were just overly mean (I.e , rebuffing all my attempts at warmth).  She went upstairs to the master bedroom (which has all my clothing but she kicked me out from sleeping in that room again a few weeks ago).  The door was locked.  For whatever reason that significantly rattled me.  I never pounded or banged.  I never yelled. But I jiggled the door handle for a bit saying \"let me in, you can't lock me out of this bedroom.  I want to sleep here tonight.  Let me in\". \n\nIn 25 years of living together I've never touched her.  Never threatened her.  Never thrown anything at her.  Nothing like that.  For whatever reason she felt terrorized and called the domestic abuse hotline.   (Note two nights later she called that hotline again since she couldn't sleep from feeling anxious of me being in the same house even though we had not interacted at all that evening and were in separate rooms)..\n\nI do sorely regret not walking away from the locked door in silence.  She set a strong boundary of not wanting to engage with me (verbally) and I tried to violate it.  Also not being able to access a bedroom i still considered shared just rattled me and activated my inner \"desire for control\".   \n\nThe next morning she announced she had made up her mind and requested a divorce and me to leave.  My whole life is in this house.  Two kids (ages 17 and 15).  All my hobbies.  My woodshop.  Etc.  \n\nI was/am devastated.  No eating or sleeping for a few days.  Dry heaving.  On Thursday we spent our first thanksgiving apart in 26 years.  \n\nI offered to immediately start that abuse program. I attended the first 2-hour session.  The other dudes there are on a different level from me-- they have threatened to kill their spouses, have inflicted physical violence, etc.  Where in 25 years I occasionally yelled, occasionally used sarcasm, some occasional contempt, and some occasional name-calling that I regret.  (In heated moments I've called her crazy and a fucking psycho before but only like 2-3 times in 25 years.  I called her a cold fish a couple times in 25 years.  She says I called her a bitch once but if I did it was only once).   The big issue she says I've always had is wanting to \"control her thoughts\".  Well I have always tried to win arguments so I accept some of this criticism as valid.  And the door thing probably did trigger some real control issues in me. But I've never tried to control her life in terms of autonomy in every other aspect.  Career.  Free time. Hobbies.  Etc.  I've always been a huge supporter of her.  \n\nShe has a whole journal filled with examples of what she sees is examples of control and verbal abuse.   Fwiw, she has also screamed at me on occasion which she calls reactive abuse.  (She hates me bringing it up but the only hole in our house caused by human emotion was from her fist and not mine).  \n\nI am trying to stop being in denial and to \"over own\" what she feels is abuse.  I think my defensiveness probably made things worse over the last few months.  But an affair revelation also destroys ones self worth and self esteem so I feel I've been fighting for some semblance of self worth.  \n\nI don't know how to proceed.  I've made a lot of money in my career so we are higher net worth.  I live in a no-fault state.\n\nI don't know how to move out.  I've asked to be \"roommates\" for a bit and she agreed.  I'm taking a business trip next week.  Holidays are coming.\n\nI'm terrified.  Terrified of being alone.  Isolated.  Lonely.  \n\nIn 6 days since the locked door last straw, she continues her extreme coldness towards me and insists her mind is made up.  \n\nI still have this slim hope she will snap out of it and not throw away the nice life we've built together.  I love her dearly.  I've decided to go \"all in\" on this intensive abusive man program.  My own family and friends feel she is being hyper-sensitive over \"little shit\" but her feelings are her feelings and of course they don't hear her side.  \n\nI know I need to find a lawyer to advise me on separating vs staying in the house.  Etc.  \n\nHer sisters and brothers, who I've known for 25+ years now, have circled the wagon and won't engage with me.  One said \"my advice is to gave her real space by moving out for a bit and doing the abuse program.  Please don't contact me again\".\n\nAny words of support, encouragement, or advice appreciated.\n\nThank you for reading.  ",

Almost daily Israeli strikes against Hezbollah, including the killing this week in Beirut of one of the militant group’s top commanders, punctuate a fraying peace. Lebanon exists in a gray zone between war and peace, which could also be the fate of Gaza as Hamas resists disarming and Israel strikes selected targets.\n\nIn effect, the war that spilled into Lebanon after the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Israel has slowed but never stopped.\n\nA morass of mistrust had now led to a dangerous escalation, and the Trump administration’s target for Hezbollah to disarm completely by the end of the year looks implausible.\n\nAcross the region, the United States is pressing to transform the Middle East by new means. “Democracy” is not part of President Trump’s lexicon. Prosperity, not the ballot box, is put forward as the new panacea. But a journey of several weeks to Lebanon, Israel and Turkey suggests that, for now, renewed war is likelier than spreading peace.\n\nThe situation in Lebanon offers a compelling example of a new Middle East where Israel’s reach is near ubiquitous. The Iran-led “axis of resistance,” of which Hezbollah has been a central part, is a shadow of its former self.\n\nThe region is adapting to what Abdulkhaleq Abdulla, a prominent political scientist in the United Arab Emirates, calls an “imperial Israel,” a country that will kill enemies anywhere: from Lebanon to Syria, Gaza to Iran, Yemen to Qatar. Pre-emptive Israeli strikes are the new norm.\n\nGiven such dominance, the United States will have to decide what constraints, if any, it will impose on Israel in the interests of furthering peace in the region. One way to achieve this may be strengthening the militaries of other regional players, like Saudi Arabia or Turkey, which Mr. Trump seems intent on doing.\n\nFor Hezbollah, diminished but defiant, the adjustment has been severe. It has not responded militarily to Israel’s attacks on Lebanon, even since they intensified after the Gaza cease-fire last month.\n\nUnder Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s war in Gaza, which killed tens of thousands of Palestinians, has hurt Israel’s image, deepened its global isolation and divided Israelis. Against this charged backdrop, it is unclear whether Israel has the political cohesion and will to turn the dominance of its armed forces into strategic security.\n\nThe Lebanese prime minister is determined to establish the Lebanese state’s exclusive right to bear arms. A largely failed state has never achieved this. This goal means disarming Hezbollah, and Mr. Salam’s underpaid, ill-equipped national army is charged with doing that. The drumbeat of Israeli strikes complicates that task on his side of the border. “We have an unchecked player acting as a hegemon under a leader, Netanyahu, growing stronger by the day,” Mr. Salam told me.\n\nEach death inflicted by Israel, or by either side, seems only to fortify the resolve of its enemies, no matter how weakened, and erode any impulse for peace.\n\nSyria’s new president, Ahmed al-Sharaa, a former Sunni jihadist who set up an affiliate of Al Qaeda in Syria before moderating his views, is no friend of Iran or of its proxies like Hezbollah.\n\nMr. Trump’s grand vision is to combine Gulf capital, Lebanese commercial ingenuity, Israeli technology and a large Arab work force to produce economic miracles that conciliate the Middle East. The United States has had bold but ill-fated plans before in the Middle East.\n\nThe Palestinian people want a state, and it seems inconceivable that money will ever alter that national ambition. This issue’s capacity to ignite war at regular intervals has been demonstrated over and over.\n\n-----\n\n[You can read a copy of the rest of the article here](https://archive.is/jphZ9), in case you cannot access the original page.\n\n-----\n\n###Some related articles that I didn't see anyone post here:\n\n####On Gaza:\n\n* [Israeli fire kills 2 Palestinian children in the latest test of Gaza ceasefire](https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-ceasefire-a83bba11bc506771aa7233326ab97e42) (Associated Press\n* [U.S. Plans Compounds to House Palestinians in Israeli-Held Half of Gaza • The project could offer relief for tens of thousands of Palestinians who have endured two years of war, but has raised questions about whether it could entrench the partition of Gaza into Israeli- and Hamas-controlled zones.](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/25/world/middleeast/us-compounds-palestinians-israel-gaza-strip.html) (New York Times)\n* [After Hundreds of Gazans Arrive on Mystery Flights, South Africa Asks How • A little-known group sold passage to desperate Palestinians who didn’t know their destination, catching the South African government by surprise.](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/17/world/africa/gaza-palestinians-south-africa-flights.html) (New York Times)\n\n####On West Bank:\n* [Israel begins West Bank operation amid settlement expansion • The IDF said it launched a \"broad counterterrorism operation\" in the West Bank.

    "title": "How to Get a Copy of a Police Report After Domestic Violence in California",
    "selftext": "If you’ve experienced domestic violence in California and the police came to the scene, a police report was likely created.

Why you might want a copy of the police report\n\nSurvivors request police reports for many reasons, including:\n\n* To support a domestic violence restraining order request\n* To show a judge what happened in a family law case (custody, divorce, support)\n* To provide proof of abuse for immigration applications (like VAWA, U visa, or other relief)\n* To request crime victim compensation or other benefits\n* To share with a therapist, advocate, or lawyer to help them understand your situation\n* To correct basic errors (like your name, date of birth, or address)\n\nYou are not required to get a copy of the report. It is your choice.\n\n# 2. Safety first: things to consider before requesting a report\n\nRequesting a report can increase risk if the abusive person might find out.

What if there is an open criminal case?\n\n# Through the prosecutor\n\nVictim-witness advocates may help you understand the report.\n\n# Through your lawyer\n\nYour lawyer can request it directly, explain it, and use it for DVRO, custody, or immigration cases.\n\n# 7. What if the police say no or only give part of the report?\n\n# Common reasons for denial:\n\n* Ongoing investigation\n* Criminal case active\n* Confidential info\n* Safety concerns for witnesses or children\n\n# Options:\n\n* Request written explanation\n* Ask for a victim summary\n* Consult a California DV lawyer\n* Work with a DV advocate\n\n# 8. Using a police report in California legal cases\n\n# DV restraining orders (DVRO)\n\nHelpful but not required.\n\n# Family law cases\n\nMay affect custody, visitation, or support.\n\n# Immigration\n\nUseful for VAWA, U-visa, etc., with a lawyer’s help.\n\n# 9. Emotional impact: reading your police report\n\nIt's common to feel:\n\n* Shock\n* Sadness\n* Anger\n* Validation\n\nRead it in a safe space and consider support from advocates or professionals.\n\n# 10.

    "title": "How to Get a Copy of a Police Report After Domestic Violence in Florida",
    "selftext": "This article provides general legal information, not legal advice. Laws change and every situation is different. Talk to a lawyer in Florida for advice about your specific situation.\n\nExperiencing domestic violence is overwhelming, and dealing with police and paperwork afterward can feel confusing or even scary. If law enforcement came to a domestic violence incident in Florida, they usually create a police report. That report can be an important record for your safety, court cases, immigration, housing, and more.\n\nThis guide explains, in plain language, how to get a copy of a police report after domestic violence in Florida, what parts may be confidential, and how to think about safety while requesting and using these records.\n\n# Why a Police Report Matters in Florida Domestic Violence Cases\n\nYou did not cause the abuse, and you are not responsible for what the other person chose to do. A police report is simply one tool that may help you move forward.\n\nA Florida domestic violence police report can:\n\n* Document what happened in writing, including date, time, and location\n* Record injuries or damage that officers observed\n* List witnesses and their contact information (if any)\n* Show the officer’s decision about arrest or charges\n* Support a petition for an injunction for protection (Florida’s term for a restraining order)\n* Help with family court (custody, visitation, divorce)\n* Support immigration applications (such as VAWA self-petitions or U visas, with legal help)\n* Help with housing or employment issues, such as explaining why you had to move suddenly\n\nYou can usually request a copy of the report even if:\n\n* You did not want the person arrested\n* You did not press charges\n* You were also arrested\n* You have since moved or left the relationship\n\nThere are some limits and privacy rules, which this article explains.\n\n# Basic Florida Law on Access to Police Reports\n\nFlorida has strong public records laws, often called the Sunshine Law. In general, police reports are public records. But domestic violence cases have special protections to help keep survivors safer.\n\nIn Florida:\n\n* Most police reports can be requested by the public, including survivors\n* Certain information is confidential, especially identifying information about victims of domestic violence and other sensitive crimes\n* Active criminal investigations may limit what can be released until the case is closed or charges are filed\n* Some information may be redacted (blacked out) before you receive the report\n\nEven though much is public, you still have rights as a victim under Florida’s Marsy’s Law and other victim rights laws. Those rights can affect how your information is shared.\n\n# Step 1: Identify Which Law Enforcement Agency Responded\n\nTo request a copy of a police report, you first need to know which agency handled the incident. In Florida, this might be:\n\n* A city police department (e.g., Orlando Police Department, Miami Police Department)\n* A county sheriff’s office (e.g., Broward Sheriff’s Office, Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office)\n* The Florida Highway Patrol (if the incident involved a vehicle or happened on a highway)\n\nLook at any paperwork you already have:\n\n* Officer business card\n* Victim information pamphlet\n* Case or incident number\n\nIf you’re not sure which agency responded, you can:\n\n* Call the local non-emergency line\n* Check old texts/emails from advocates or officers\n* Search: **\"\\[City\\] police public records\"** or **\"\\[County\\] sheriff public records\"**\n\n# Step 2: Gather Basic Information About the Incident\n\nHelpful details include:\n\n* Date (or approximate date)\n* Location\n* Your name (and any former names)\n* Name of the abusive person (if safe to share)\n* Case number, if you have it\n\nIf you don’t have a case number, most agencies can search by name and date.\n\n# Step 3: Decide How You Want to Request the Report\n\nFlorida agencies typically accept requests:\n\n* Online\n* In person\n* By email\n* By phone (for instructions)\n* By mail or fax\n\nSearch for:\n\n&gt;\n\n# Safety considerations\n\nIf the abusive person monitors your:\n\n* Phone\n* Email\n* Mail\n* Devices\n\n…then consider:\n\n* Using a safe email address\n* Picking up the report in person\n* Using a trusted friend’s address\n* Having a lawyer or advocate request it for you\n\n# Step 4: Make the Request (What to Say or Write)\n\nYou do **not** need to explain why you want it.\n\n# Sample request\n\n&gt;\n\n# Step 5: Understand Possible Fees and Timelines\n\n# Fees\n\nAgencies may charge:\n\n* Small per-page fees\n* Extra for certified copies\n* Additional labor fees for large or complex searches\n\n# Timelines\n\nReports may be available:\n\n* Within a few days, **or**\n* Longer if the case is under investigation\n\nIf the case is active, expect:\n\n* Delays\n* Heavier redaction\n\n# What Parts of a Florida Domestic Violence Report May Be Confidential?\n\nCommon redactions include:\n\n* Your home address\n* Your phone number\n* Your email\n* Identifying information of children\n* Information that identifies a domestic violence, sexual violence, or stalking victim\n\nThese protections reduce risk of harassment or tracking.\n\n# Can victims get more details?\n\nPossibly. You can:\n\n* Ask for a **less-redacted copy**\n* Have a lawyer request additional records\n* Speak with a State Attorney victim advocate\n\n# What If the Abusive Person Tries to Get the Report?\n\nFlorida’s public records laws mean they **may** be able to request it.\n\nHowever, they usually receive:\n\n* A **redacted** version\n* With your protected information removed\n\nIf you’re worried:\n\n* Make a safety plan with an advocate\n* Inform your lawyer or SAO victim advocate\n* Document any new threats\n\nCall 911 if you’re in danger.\n\n# Using a Police Report in Florida Court or Other Processes\n\n# Injunctions for protection\n\nA police report can:\n\n* Support your petition\n* Help the judge understand the incident\n\nYou can:\n\n* Attach it to your petition\n* Bring it to your hearing\n\nBut **you do not need a police report** to file for an injunction.\n\n# Criminal cases\n\nThe State Attorney’s Office uses the police report in prosecution. Victim advocates can help you understand your rights and what’s in the report.\n\n# Other uses\n\nPolice reports may help in:\n\n* Custody and divorce\n* Immigration\n* Housing\n* Employment\n\nAsk a lawyer for guidance.\n\n# What If You Were Also Arrested or Labeled the “Primary Aggressor”?\n\nThis happens to survivors more often than people realize.\n\nYou still have the right to:\n\n* Request the report\n* Get legal representation\n* Receive support from DV advocates\n\nA defense lawyer can explain how the report affects your case.\n\n# What If There Is No Police Report?\n\nThis can happen if:\n\n* Officers left quickly\n* The call was classified differently\n* The agency wrote minimal documentation\n\nYou can still document your experience with:\n\n* Photos\n* Text messages\n* Emails\n* Journals\n* Witness statements\n\n# Safety Planning Around Police Reports\n\nA Florida DV advocate can help you consider:\n\n* Whether requesting the report now is safe\n* Where to store it\n* Who to share it with\n* What to do if the abusive person reacts\n\nYou deserve support.\n\n# Getting Help in Florida\n\nYou can:\n\n* Contact a certified Florida domestic violence center\n* Reach a State Attorney victim advocate\n* Speak with a DV, family law, or criminal defense lawyer\n\nHotlines and local DV programs can guide you to the right services.\n\n# Key Takeaways\n\n* Florida police reports are generally public, but DV victims get added confidentiality.\n* You can usually request the report from the responding agency.\n* You do not have to explain why you want it.\n* Some information will be redacted.\n* The report can support injunctions, criminal cases, custody, immigration, and more.\n* Safety planning is important when requesting and storing the report.\n\nYou deserve clear information, support, and protection.\n\n# Frequently Asked Questions\n\n# Can I get a copy if I didn’t press charges?\n\nYes. The right to request the report is **separate** from the decision to prosecute.\n\n# How much does it cost?\n\nUsually small per-page fees; sometimes more for certified or large requests.\n\n# Will my address be visible?\n\nOften **no** — it is frequently redacted.\n\n# Can the abusive person get a copy?\n\nPossibly, but usually only a **redacted** version.\n\n# How long does it take?\n\nA few days to several weeks, depending on the investigation status.\n\n# Do I need a police report for an injunction?\n\nNo — but having one can help.\n\n# What if I was also arrested?\n\nYou can still request the report and should talk to a defense lawyer.\n\n# Can I request a report without giving my name?\n\nYes, under public records law you generally can — but providing your name can help staff identify the correct report.",

    "title": "Kokrajhar Violence: Is Northeast India Heading Back to Militancy?",
    "selftext": "The ST status violence in Kokrajhar is not any other protest; if mishandled, it can destabilize the whole Northeast.\n\nThe Assam government granted Scheduled Tribe status to 6 communities - Tai Ahom, Chutia, Moran, Matak, Koch-Rajbongshi and Tea Tribes, which account for 1.5 crore people. The existing tribal groups comprising a population of 50 lakh people are protesting violently, fearing their rights and resources would be diluted. Students stormed the BTC Secretariat, vandalised the assembly building.\n\nAn IED blast near the Kokrajhar railway track this November 2024 is a warning sign - the FIRST since the 2020 peace accord.\n\nThis is dangerous because of \n\n1. History Repeats Itself Northeast spent decades in militancy, 1980s-2000s. ULFA, Bodo militants, Karbi groups-all of these came from similar ethnic grievances and resource conflicts. We finally got peace, and we are creating the very conditions that created violence.\n\n2. The Domino Effect If Bodos get concessions through agitation, every other tribe will demand the same. Karbi Anglong, Dimasa areas, other tribal regions-all have historical grievances. One success triggers multiple movements.\n\n3. Militant Recruitment Opportunity ULFA is weakened, but not dead. Prolonged chaos in any form creates a perfect recruiting ground for militant groups. Frustrated tribal youth + economic insecurity + ethnic tension = militant resurgence.\n\n4. Resource Mathematics Doesn't Add Up 50 lakh existing tribals vs 1.5 crore new claimants for the SAME benefits and reservations. This is unsustainable. Either the existing tribes lose big time, or the new communities get nothing - either way, conflict is guaranteed.\n\nI have some Questions for  the Government\n\nHow do you prevent benefit dilution for existing tribes while still being fair to new claimants?\n\nWhat happens if other tribes would also ask for separate statehood?\n\nThe IED blast has already occurred-what is your plan to counter the resurgence of militants?\n\nHave you learned NOTHING from decades of Northeast insurgency?\n\nThis could cascade into years of ethnic violence, militant activity, and instability across Assam and other neighboring states. We have been there before. It took decades and thousands of lives to achieve peace. Are we really going to throw it away over poor policy decisions?\n\nAll the Northeast is asking for is to not recreate the conditions that led to militancy in the first place.\n\nWhere are the leaders? Where's the dialogue? Where's the plan? This needs urgent attention before it spirals out of control.",

    "selftext": "TW: Physical violence, sexual assault\n\n  \nI wish I could cry.\n\nIt's a talent I lost years ago and now I just feel frustrated and angry, rather than sad. I do the things I was told, I take my meds, go to work, see a therapist. Yet no tears and I still only see the damaged man in the mirror.\n\n  \nI was bullied my entire youth. Always the new kid due to moving constantly from city to city. Undiagnosed AuDHD made it difficult for me to see things the same way as other kids, and I paid a price for it. I was called names, belittled, beaten up, my stuff would go missing. .  you name it. I became a regular at the nurses office, and later at the local hospital to check if my ribs were fractured.\n\n  \nAccepting I was gay was rough later on, and I started working on the damage. Learning to hug and be hugged, learning that not all people wanted to hurt me, learning to ask for help. I fell in love with a guy who helped me a lot, but when he realized how much work there was... he wasn't ready to walk the entire way with me.\n\n  \nFew months later, another guy raped me.\n\nHe hurt me on purpose, taking enjoyment out of it. I'll spare the details, but I left that situation as a different man. The old wounds re-opened, I went into full isolation mode. I didn't know what to do, who to talk to, just.. anything. So, I just went back to the office on Monday and kept working like everything was fine inside my head.\n\n  \nIt's been two years now since it happened. I'm trying to heal, to be better, to.. feel something other than anger. I'm seeing a therapist now, I'm on SSRI-meds to try and keep the monster at bay. Working myself to the edge of burnout on repeat because being home alone amplifies the pain. \n\n  \nI hate feeling this helpless. I hate constantly feeling angry. I hate not being able to cry properly, as the tears just wont come out. I wish I could love someone, to be in someones arms who tells me that things are going to be OK.  \nYet I fear, that the damage runs too deep and finding love, companionship, whatever you want to call it, might be too far of a dream. It doesn't seem to be getting any easier anytime soon.\n\n  \nSo here's a toast, to the broken souls on the road to healing, as bitter as it is.",

    "title": "How to Get a Copy of a Police Report After Domestic Violence in New Jersey",
    "selftext": "*This article provides general legal information, not legal advice. Laws change and every situation is different. Talk to a lawyer in New Jersey for advice about your specific situation.*\n\nExperiencing domestic violence is overwhelming. If the police were called, you may later need a copy of the police report for court, immigration, housing, work, or your own records.\n\nIn New Jersey, getting a copy of a police report after a domestic violence incident can feel confusing — especially when you are already under stress. This guide explains the process step-by-step, highlights important safety issues, and helps you understand your options.\n\n# Why you might need a copy of a domestic violence police report\n\nSurvivors in New Jersey often request a police report for reasons such as:\n\n* Applying for or extending a Temporary or Final Restraining Order (TRO/FRO)\n* Preparing for family court (custody or parenting time cases)\n* Participating in a criminal case\n* Applying for victim compensation\n* Supporting immigration cases (VAWA, U visa, etc.)\n* Providing documentation to a landlord, employer, or school\n* Keeping personal records for safety and future planning\n\nYou are **not required** to have a police report to get help or be believed. But when it exists, it can be an important document.\n\n# Key things to know about New Jersey police reports in domestic violence cases\n\n# 1. Police reports are usually public records — but DV cases get extra protection\n\nNew Jersey’s Open Public Records Act (OPRA) generally allows the public to request police reports.\n\nHowever, **domestic violence cases have enhanced confidentiality**, especially for:\n\n* Addresses and contact information\n* Information about children\n* Medical or mental health details\n* Sensitive personal information\n\nThese sections may be **redacted (blacked out)** before the report is released.\n\n# 2. There may be multiple types of records\n\nA DV incident in New Jersey may produce:\n\n* Police incident/offense report\n* Domestic Violence Offense Report\n* TRO/FRO paperwork\n* Criminal complaint or warrant\n* Body camera footage\n* 911 recordings\n* Photos taken by police\n\nEach may have different rules for access.\n\n# 3. Timing matters\n\nYou may face delays if:\n\n* A criminal investigation is still ongoing\n* The report involves minors\n* Prosecutors request temporary nondisclosure\n\nBasic incident information is typically available earlier than detailed reports.\n\n# 4. You do NOT have to request alone\n\nAdvocates and attorneys can:\n\n* Help you complete forms\n* Think through safety risks\n* Communicate with police on your behalf\n* Store records safely\n\n# Safety planning before requesting your police report\n\nRequesting records can increase risk if the abusive person:\n\n* Lives with you\n* Checks your mail\n* Monitors your phone or email\n* Has threatened you about involving the police\n\nConsider:\n\n# Safe ways to receive the report\n\n* Attorney’s office\n* DV advocate’s office\n* PO box\n* Trusted friend/family member’s address\n* A safe email account the abuser cannot access\n\n# Safe storage options\n\n* Outside the home\n* With an advocate\n* Secure password-protected cloud storage\n* Encrypted digital folder\n\nTalk with a New Jersey DV advocate for help creating a safety plan.\n\n# Step-by-step: How to request a police report in New Jersey\n\n# Step 1: Identify the correct police department\n\nIt may be:\n\n* A municipal police department\n* A county sheriff’s office\n* New Jersey State Police\n\nCheck any paperwork you received. If unsure, call the non-emergency number for the town where the incident occurred.\n\n# Step 2: Gather identifying details\n\nHelpful information:\n\n* Your full name and DOB\n* Date or approximate date of the incident\n* Location\n* Abusive person’s name (if known)\n* Police case/incident number\n\nIf you don’t have all of this — that’s okay. Provide what you can.\n\n# Step 3: Choose how to request the report\n\nMost NJ departments accept requests:\n\n1. **In person**\n2. **Online** (many use OPRA portals)\n3. **By mail or email** (using an OPRA form)\n\nAsk:\n\n&gt;\n\n# Step 4: Understand OPRA vs. victim-specific access\n\nThere are two pathways:\n\n# A. OPRA request (public records request)\n\n* Standard process\n* Must be answered within 7 business days\n* May include more redactions\n\n# B. Victim-specific request\n\nSome departments allow victims to request certain records without a formal OPRA request.\n\nYou can ask:\n\n&gt;\n\n# Step 5: Complete the request form\n\nForms may be labeled:\n\n* OPRA Request Form\n* Police Records Request\n* Incident Report Request\n\nIn your request, write:\n\n&gt;\n\nYou can request the report be sent to an attorney or advocate for safety.\n\n# Step 6: Ask about fees and processing times\n\nMost departments:\n\n* Charge small fees for paper copies\n* Provide digital copies for little or no cost\n\nAsk:\n\n* “Is there a fee?”\n* “Can I receive it electronically?”\n* “When should I expect a response?”\n\n# Step 7: Receive and store your report safely\n\nChoose the safest delivery method:\n\n* In person\n* Email to a safe account\n* Mail to a safe address\n\nIf picking up in person, consider bringing someone with you.\n\n# What you might see in a New Jersey domestic violence police report\n\nPolice reports often include:\n\n* Names and basic information\n* Officer’s narrative\n* Observed injuries or damage\n* Listed charges\n* DV offense forms\n* Witness names (sometimes redacted)\n\nIt’s normal for reports to feel incomplete — they reflect the officer’s snapshot, not your full experience.\n\n# Who else can access the report?\n\n# The abusive person may get access in certain situations\n\n* If they are a defendant in a criminal case\n* Through their attorney\n* Through an OPRA request (with DV-specific redactions)\n\nProtected information may include:\n\n* Your address\n* Children’s details\n* Medical information\n* Sensitive identifiers\n\nIf worried, speak with:\n\n* A DV advocate\n* The prosecutor’s victim-witness office\n* A New Jersey attorney\n\n# If your request is denied\n\nCommon reasons:\n\n* Ongoing investigation\n* Juvenile involvement\n* Privacy protections\n* Request too broad\n\nIf denied:\n\n1. Read the explanation\n2. Call the records custodian for clarification\n3. Narrow or modify your request\n4. Consider an OPRA appeal\n\nAppeals can go through:\n\n* The **Government Records Council (GRC)**\n* The **New Jersey Superior Court**\n\nGet legal advice before filing an appeal.\n\n# Other records you may request\n\nSome require more steps:\n\n* 911 recordings\n* Body camera footage\n* Dispatch logs\n* Photos\n* TRO/FRO court records\n\nThese often require:\n\n* A subpoena\n* Court order\n* Request through the prosecutor\n\n# How police reports are used in NJ legal cases\n\n# Restraining orders (TRO/FRO)\n\nJudges may consider the report but it is **not required**.\n\n# Criminal cases\n\nProsecutors and defense attorneys use the report to prepare the case.\n\n# Family court (custody/parenting time)\n\nReports can support a pattern of abuse, but judges consider the whole context.\n\n# Immigration cases\n\nReports can support VAWA, U visa, or similar applications.\n\nAlways consider reviewing the report with a lawyer or advocate first.\n\n# Emotional impact: What to expect\n\nIt is normal to feel:\n\n* Overwhelmed\n* Triggered\n* Validated\n* Angry\n* Confused\n\nYour feelings are valid. You can:\n\n* Read the report with a trusted advocate\n* Take breaks\n* Seek emotional support\n\n# When to talk to a New Jersey lawyer\n\nIt is helpful to speak with an attorney if:\n\n* You have a TRO/FRO case\n* You are involved in criminal or custody proceedings\n* Your request was denied\n* You have immigration concerns\n* You are worried about the abuser seeing your report\n\nLawyers can also help request additional records safely.\n\n# Practical tips for New Jersey survivors\n\n* Write down details while they are fresh\n* Keep copies of all requests\n* Use contact information the abuser cannot access\n* Ask for help from advocates or legal aid\n* Request records when **you** feel ready\n\nYou deserve safety, clarity, and support.\n\n# Frequently Asked Questions\n\n# Can I get a copy of the report if there is an ongoing criminal case?\n\nYou can usually get a **basic incident report**, but detailed reports may be withheld during an active investigation.\n\n# Will my abuser see the report?\n\nIf they are charged with a crime, their attorney will likely receive the report — but sensitive information can be redacted.\n\n# How long does it take to receive the report?\n\nOPRA requires a response within **7 business days**, but DV-related records may take longer.\n\n# Do I have to pay?\n\nPaper copies typically cost a small fee; digital copies may be free.\n\n# What if the report is wrong?\n\nPolice reports are summaries. Talk with a lawyer about how to clarify the record in court.\n\n# Can I request 911 recordings or bodycam video?\n\nYes, but they often require a subpoena or prosecutor involvement.\n\n# Do I need a lawyer to make the request?\n\nNo, but a lawyer is helpful for restraining order, criminal, immigration, or custody cases.\n\n# Is it safe to keep the report at home?\n\nIf you live with the abusive person, consider storing the report elsewhere to reduce risk.\n\n",

    "title": "How to Get a Copy of a Police Report After Domestic Violence in New Jersey",
    "selftext": "*This article provides general legal information, not legal advice. Laws change and every situation is different. Talk to a lawyer in New Jersey for advice about your specific situation.*\n\nExperiencing domestic violence is overwhelming. If the police were called, you may later need a copy of the police report for court, immigration, housing, work, or your own records.\n\nIn New Jersey, getting a copy of a police report after a domestic violence incident can feel confusing — especially when you are already under stress. This guide explains the process step-by-step, highlights important safety issues, and helps you understand your options.\n\n# Why you might need a copy of a domestic violence police report\n\nSurvivors in New Jersey often request a police report for reasons such as:\n\n* Applying for or extending a Temporary or Final Restraining Order (TRO/FRO)\n* Preparing for family court (custody or parenting time cases)\n* Participating in a criminal case\n* Applying for victim compensation\n* Supporting immigration cases (VAWA, U visa, etc.)\n* Providing documentation to a landlord, employer, or school\n* Keeping personal records for safety and future planning\n\nYou are **not required** to have a police report to get help or be believed. But when it exists, it can be an important document.\n\n# Key things to know about New Jersey police reports in domestic violence cases\n\n# 1. Police reports are usually public records — but DV cases get extra protection\n\nNew Jersey’s Open Public Records Act (OPRA) generally allows the public to request police reports.\n\nHowever, **domestic violence cases have enhanced confidentiality**, especially for:\n\n* Addresses and contact information\n* Information about children\n* Medical or mental health details\n* Sensitive personal information\n\nThese sections may be **redacted (blacked out)** before the report is released.\n\n# 2. There may be multiple types of records\n\nA DV incident in New Jersey may produce:\n\n* Police incident/offense report\n* Domestic Violence Offense Report\n* TRO/FRO paperwork\n* Criminal complaint or warrant\n* Body camera footage\n* 911 recordings\n* Photos taken by police\n\nEach may have different rules for access.\n\n# 3. Timing matters\n\nYou may face delays if:\n\n* A criminal investigation is still ongoing\n* The report involves minors\n* Prosecutors request temporary nondisclosure\n\nBasic incident information is typically available earlier than detailed reports.\n\n# 4. You do NOT have to request alone\n\nAdvocates and attorneys can:\n\n* Help you complete forms\n* Think through safety risks\n* Communicate with police on your behalf\n* Store records safely\n\n# Safety planning before requesting your police report\n\nRequesting records can increase risk if the abusive person:\n\n* Lives with you\n* Checks your mail\n* Monitors your phone or email\n* Has threatened you about involving the police\n\nConsider:\n\n# Safe ways to receive the report\n\n* Attorney’s office\n* DV advocate’s office\n* PO box\n* Trusted friend/family member’s address\n* A safe email account the abuser cannot access\n\n# Safe storage options\n\n* Outside the home\n* With an advocate\n* Secure password-protected cloud storage\n* Encrypted digital folder\n\nTalk with a New Jersey DV advocate for help creating a safety plan.\n\n# Step-by-step: How to request a police report in New Jersey\n\n# Step 1: Identify the correct police department\n\nIt may be:\n\n* A municipal police department\n* A county sheriff’s office\n* New Jersey State Police\n\nCheck any paperwork you received. If unsure, call the non-emergency number for the town where the incident occurred.\n\n# Step 2: Gather identifying details\n\nHelpful information:\n\n* Your full name and DOB\n* Date or approximate date of the incident\n* Location\n* Abusive person’s name (if known)\n* Police case/incident number\n\nIf you don’t have all of this — that’s okay. Provide what you can.\n\n# Step 3: Choose how to request the report\n\nMost NJ departments accept requests:\n\n1. **In person**\n2. **Online** (many use OPRA portals)\n3. **By mail or email** (using an OPRA form)\n\nAsk:\n\n&gt;\n\n# Step 4: Understand OPRA vs. victim-specific access\n\nThere are two pathways:\n\n# A. OPRA request (public records request)\n\n* Standard process\n* Must be answered within 7 business days\n* May include more redactions\n\n# B. Victim-specific request\n\nSome departments allow victims to request certain records without a formal OPRA request.\n\nYou can ask:\n\n&gt;\n\n# Step 5: Complete the request form\n\nForms may be labeled:\n\n* OPRA Request Form\n* Police Records Request\n* Incident Report Request\n\nIn your request, write:\n\n&gt;\n\nYou can request the report be sent to an attorney or advocate for safety.\n\n# Step 6: Ask about fees and processing times\n\nMost departments:\n\n* Charge small fees for paper copies\n* Provide digital copies for little or no cost\n\nAsk:\n\n* “Is there a fee?”\n* “Can I receive it electronically?”\n* “When should I expect a response?”\n\n# Step 7: Receive and store your report safely\n\nChoose the safest delivery method:\n\n* In person\n* Email to a safe account\n* Mail to a safe address\n\nIf picking up in person, consider bringing someone with you.\n\n# What you might see in a New Jersey domestic violence police report\n\nPolice reports often include:\n\n* Names and basic information\n* Officer’s narrative\n* Observed injuries or damage\n* Listed charges\n* DV offense forms\n* Witness names (sometimes redacted)\n\nIt’s normal for reports to feel incomplete — they reflect the officer’s snapshot, not your full experience.\n\n# Who else can access the report?\n\n# The abusive person may get access in certain situations\n\n* If they are a defendant in a criminal case\n* Through their attorney\n* Through an OPRA request (with DV-specific redactions)\n\nProtected information may include:\n\n* Your address\n* Children’s details\n* Medical information\n* Sensitive identifiers\n\nIf worried, speak with:\n\n* A DV advocate\n* The prosecutor’s victim-witness office\n* A New Jersey attorney\n\n# If your request is denied\n\nCommon reasons:\n\n* Ongoing investigation\n* Juvenile involvement\n* Privacy protections\n* Request too broad\n\nIf denied:\n\n1. Read the explanation\n2. Call the records custodian for clarification\n3. Narrow or modify your request\n4. Consider an OPRA appeal\n\nAppeals can go through:\n\n* The **Government Records Council (GRC)**\n* The **New Jersey Superior Court**\n\nGet legal advice before filing an appeal.\n\n# Other records you may request\n\nSome require more steps:\n\n* 911 recordings\n* Body camera footage\n* Dispatch logs\n* Photos\n* TRO/FRO court records\n\nThese often require:\n\n* A subpoena\n* Court order\n* Request through the prosecutor\n\n# How police reports are used in NJ legal cases\n\n# Restraining orders (TRO/FRO)\n\nJudges may consider the report but it is **not required**.\n\n# Criminal cases\n\nProsecutors and defense attorneys use the report to prepare the case.\n\n# Family court (custody/parenting time)\n\nReports can support a pattern of abuse, but judges consider the whole context.\n\n# Immigration cases\n\nReports can support VAWA, U visa, or similar applications.\n\nAlways consider reviewing the report with a lawyer or advocate first.\n\n# Emotional impact: What to expect\n\nIt is normal to feel:\n\n* Overwhelmed\n* Triggered\n* Validated\n* Angry\n* Confused\n\nYour feelings are valid. You can:\n\n* Read the report with a trusted advocate\n* Take breaks\n* Seek emotional support\n\n# When to talk to a New Jersey lawyer\n\nIt is helpful to speak with an attorney if:\n\n* You have a TRO/FRO case\n* You are involved in criminal or custody proceedings\n* Your request was denied\n* You have immigration concerns\n* You are worried about the abuser seeing your report\n\nLawyers can also help request additional records safely.\n\n# Practical tips for New Jersey survivors\n\n* Write down details while they are fresh\n* Keep copies of all requests\n* Use contact information the abuser cannot access\n* Ask for help from advocates or legal aid\n* Request records when **you** feel ready\n\nYou deserve safety, clarity, and support.\n\n# Frequently Asked Questions\n\n# Can I get a copy of the report if there is an ongoing criminal case?\n\nYou can usually get a **basic incident report**, but detailed reports may be withheld during an active investigation.\n\n# Will my abuser see the report?\n\nIf they are charged with a crime, their attorney will likely receive the report — but sensitive information can be redacted.\n\n# How long does it take to receive the report?\n\nOPRA requires a response within **7 business days**, but DV-related records may take longer.\n\n# Do I have to pay?\n\nPaper copies typically cost a small fee; digital copies may be free.\n\n# What if the report is wrong?\n\nPolice reports are summaries. Talk with a lawyer about how to clarify the record in court.\n\n# Can I request 911 recordings or bodycam video?\n\nYes, but they often require a subpoena or prosecutor involvement.\n\n# Do I need a lawyer to make the request?\n\nNo, but a lawyer is helpful for restraining order, criminal, immigration, or custody cases.\n\n# Is it safe to keep the report at home?\n\nIf you live with the abusive person, consider storing the report elsewhere to reduce risk.\n\n",

    "selftext": "*This article provides general legal information, not legal advice. Laws change and every situation is different. Talk to a lawyer in New York for advice about your specific situation.*\n\nIf you called the police because of domestic violence in New York, there is usually a police report. Wanting a copy is completely understandable. You may need it for:\n\n* A family court case (custody, order of protection)\n* A criminal case\n* Immigration applications\n* Housing, shelter, or benefits\n* Work, school, or safety planning\n\nThis guide explains, in plain language, how police reports work in New York and how you may be able to get a copy, step by step.\n\nYou did nothing wrong by calling the police. You deserve information, clarity, and support.\n\n# Key things to know about New York police reports in domestic violence cases\n\n# 1. There may be more than one type of record\n\nIn a New York domestic violence incident, there may be multiple records:\n\n* **Domestic Incident Report (DIR)** — A required NY police form for all “domestic incidents.”\n* **Incident/Complaint Report** — The general police report.\n* **Arrest Report** — If someone was arrested.\n* **911 Call Recording or CAD Log** — Emergency call audio or dispatch log.\n\nYou may be able to get some records but not others, especially if a criminal case is open.\n\n# 2. Some information is confidential or restricted\n\nAccess may be limited if:\n\n* A criminal investigation is ongoing\n* You are a protected party in an order of protection\n* Children/minors were involved\n* Sensitive personal information appears\n\nYou may receive a **redacted** copy, or you may need to wait until the criminal case ends.\n\n# 3. Different agencies may hold the records\n\nRecords may be held by:\n\n* **NYPD** (if the incident happened in NYC)\n* **Local police** (if outside NYC)\n* **County Sheriff’s Office**\n* **District Attorney’s Office** (if criminal charges were filed)\n\nWhen unsure, start with the agency that responded.\n\n# 4. New York’s Freedom of Information Law (FOIL)\n\nFOIL allows people to request many government records, but:\n\n* Agencies can deny requests\n* Agencies can provide only partial records\n* Agencies can delay release during investigations\n\nYou can appeal a denial, but the process can be draining — a lawyer or advocate can help.\n\n# Safety first: Things to consider before requesting a police report\n\nRequesting a police report can help, but it may also create safety risks.\n\n# Think about how the abusive person might react\n\nThey might:\n\n* Learn you requested the report\n* See information that upsets them\n* Gain access to your address or contact info\n\nConsider:\n\n* Speaking with a DV advocate first\n* Using a safe address (friend, lawyer, PO box)\n* Asking if the agency can redact your address\n* Asking for electronic delivery (if safer)\n\n# Get support if possible\n\nIn New York, confidential support is available through:\n\n* Domestic violence programs and shelters\n* Legal aid organizations\n* Family Justice Centers (NYC)\n\nAdvocates can help you:\n\n* Decide if/when to request the report\n* Understand the safest method\n* Navigate police stations, FOIL requests, or courts\n\nIf in immediate danger, call 911.  \nFor confidential DV support: **New York State Hotline 1-800-942-6906** (voice) or text **844-997-2121**.\n\n# Step-by-step: How to request a domestic violence police report in New York\n\n# Step 1: Identify the agency and basic details\n\nTry to gather:\n\n* Date/time of the incident\n* Location/address\n* Name of arrested person (if any)\n* Your name and date of birth\n* Incident/complaint/DIR number (if you have it)\n* The police department involved\n\nIf you do not have all of this, the agency may still find your report.\n\n# Step 2: Decide what records you want\n\nCommon records to request:\n\n* **Domestic Incident Report (DIR)**\n* **Incident/Complaint Report**\n* **Arrest Report**\n* **911 recording or CAD log**\n\nA sample request:\n\n&gt;\n\nIf unsure, you can ask for “any police records related to the domestic incident on \\[date\\] where I was the victim.”\n\n# Step 3: Check the local process\n\n# A. If the incident happened in New York City (NYPD)\n\nYou may:\n\n* Contact the precinct directly\n* Request through the **NYPD Records Unit**\n* Submit a FOIL request through the **NYC OpenRecords** portal\n\nIf you have a lawyer, they may request it directly.\n\n# B. If the incident happened outside NYC\n\n* Visit the police department’s website\n* Look for “Records,” “FOIL,” or “Public Records”\n* Many departments allow in-person or written FOIL requests\n\nYou can call:\n\n&gt;\n\n# C. If there is a criminal case\n\nThe **District Attorney’s Office** may provide:\n\n* Case updates\n* Limited information\n* Access to certain documents\n\nAsk to speak with a **victim advocate** in the DA’s Office.\n\n# Step 4: Decide whether to file a FOIL request\n\nIf required, submit a FOIL request:\n\n* Online or by email\n* With identifying details\n* Asking for specific documents\n* Requesting non-exempt portions if redactions are required\n\nSample FOIL language:\n\n&gt;\n\n# Step 5: Provide ID if requested\n\nThey may ask for:\n\n* Photo ID\n* Your date of birth\n* Proof you are the victim\n\nIf worried, ask to:\n\n* Redact your address from the ID copy\n* Provide ID in person only\n* Have the report sent to a lawyer or advocate\n\n# Step 6: Wait for the agency’s response\n\nAgencies must:\n\n* Acknowledge your FOIL request\n* Provide a timeline\n* Grant, partially grant, or deny the request\n\nIf denied, you can file a **FOIL appeal** (usually within 30 days).\n\n# Step 7: Review the report safely\n\nWhen you receive the report:\n\n* Open it in a safe location\n* Expect redactions\n* Expect the wording to feel clinical or incomplete\n* Consider reading it with support\n\nIt is normal for police reports to feel upsetting or inaccurate.\n\n# What if the police report doesn’t match your memory?\n\nPolice reports are often:\n\n* Summaries\n* Rushed\n* Written from one perspective\n\nIt is common to feel upset if:\n\n* Details are missing\n* Your words are oversimplified\n* The abuser’s lies appear in the report\n\nThis does **not** mean you did anything wrong.\n\nYou can:\n\n* Write your own timeline\n* Discuss concerns with your lawyer\n* Bring additional evidence for court\n\n# Special situations: Orders of protection, family court, immigration\n\n# Using a police report for an order of protection\n\nA police report can help, but:\n\n* It is **not required**\n* Judges can grant orders based on your sworn statement alone\n\n# Using a police report in family court\n\nA report may help show:\n\n* A history of violence\n* Safety concerns for custody or visitation\n\nThe judge will consider multiple factors, not just the report.\n\n# Using a police report for immigration\n\nFor U visas, VAWA, T visas, etc.:\n\n* A police report can support your application\n* Your immigration lawyer may request it\n* They may advise on the safest way to obtain records\n\n# What if the abusive person uses the report against you?\n\nAbusers sometimes try to:\n\n* Obtain the report\n* Share it\n* Twist parts of it\n\nThis is manipulation — not your fault.\n\nYou can:\n\n* Talk to a lawyer\n* Work with a DV advocate\n* Save messages or evidence showing the full story\n\nIf they publicly share your private information, this may be harassment.\n\n# Cost, timing, and practical tips\n\n# How much does it cost?\n\nVaries by agency:\n\n* Copy fees ($0.25/page typical)\n* Extra fees for 911 audio\n\nYou may request a **fee waiver**.\n\n# How long does it take?\n\n* Some reports: days to weeks\n* FOIL requests: weeks to months\n* Criminal cases: may delay release until case ends\n\n# Practical tips\n\n* Keep copies of all requests\n* Document who you spoke with and when\n* Update your contact info if you move\n* If treated poorly, ask for a supervisor\n\n# When to talk to a lawyer or advocate\n\nSeek help if:\n\n* Your request was denied\n* You have a court case coming up\n* You fear retaliation\n* You want to appeal a FOIL denial\n\nYou can find help through:\n\n* Legal aid\n* DV legal programs\n* Bar association referrals\n\nUse our directory to **find a New York domestic violence lawyer**.\n\n# You are allowed to seek information and support\n\nRequesting a police report can be intimidating.  \nBut understanding what was written is your right — and your choice.\n\nYou deserve:\n\n* Clear information\n* Respect\n* Safety\n* Support\n\nMove at your own pace. You never have to do this alone.\n\n# Frequently Asked Questions\n\n# Can I get a copy of the DV police report if a criminal case is open?\n\nSometimes, but the agency may delay release under FOIL. You may get limited information through the DA’s Office.\n\n# How do I request a Domestic Incident Report (DIR)?\n\nContact the responding police department. They may direct you to their FOIL unit or (in NYC) the NYC OpenRecords portal.\n\n# Will my address be visible?\n\nIt depends. You can request redaction or use a safe address for delivery.\n\n# Do I need a police report for an order of protection?\n\nNo. Judges regularly grant orders without police involvement.\n\n# How long does it take?\n\nAnywhere from days to months, depending on FOIL and whether a criminal case is open.\n\n# Can the abusive person get a copy?\n\nOften yes, especially after a criminal case ends or through their lawyer. Some information may be redacted.\n\n# What if my FOIL request is denied?\n\nYou can appeal within the agency’s deadline, usually within 30 days. A lawyer or legal aid office can help.",

    "title": "How to Get a Copy of a Police Report After Domestic Violence in Alaska",
    "selftext": "*This article provides general legal information, not legal advice. Laws change and every situation is different. Talk to a lawyer in Alaska for advice about your specific situation.*\n\nIf the police responded to a domestic violence incident in Alaska, they usually create a police report. That report can feel important — and sometimes overwhelming — because it becomes part of the official record of what happened.\n\nYou might want a copy to:\n\n* Apply for a protective order\n* Show a lawyer what happened\n* Request changes in custody or parenting time\n* Ask your landlord or employer for safety accommodations\n* Keep for your personal records\n\nThis guide explains how the process works in Alaska, what your options are, and safety issues to consider.\n\n# 1. Basic facts about police reports in Alaska\n\n# What is a police report?\n\nA police report is a written record created by law enforcement after they respond to an incident. In Alaska domestic violence cases, it may include:\n\n* Date, time, and location\n* Names of people involved\n* Statements from you, the other person, and witnesses\n* Officer observations\n* Photos or descriptions of injuries or damage\n* Details about arrests or charges\n\nThis report is mainly for law enforcement and prosecutors — it is not a court order or a conviction.\n\n# Who creates the report in Alaska?\n\nDomestic violence incidents may be handled by:\n\n* Anchorage Police Department\n* Fairbanks Police Department\n* Juneau Police Department\n* Other city/borough police\n* Alaska State Troopers (common in rural areas and villages)\n\nEach agency keeps its own records, but Alaska law sets statewide rules about access.\n\n# 2. Can you get a copy of a domestic violence police report in Alaska?\n\nIt depends on:\n\n* Whether you are the victim in the report\n* Whether a criminal investigation is open\n* Whether some parts are confidential\n\n# Alaska’s public records rule\n\nAlaska law generally allows public access to records, but there are exceptions for:\n\n* Ongoing criminal investigations\n* Sensitive victim/witness information\n* Juvenile information\n* Private personal data\n\nThis means:\n\n* Some or all of a report may be withheld while a case is open\n* Released copies may have redactions (blacked-out sections)\n\n# If you are the victim/survivor\n\nYou often have broader access than the general public, but:\n\n* Agencies may still limit access during investigations\n* Prosecutors may prefer victims receive information directly through them\n\nYou can always call the police agency’s Records Division or the district attorney to ask about your specific case.\n\n# 3. Safety planning before requesting a report\n\nBefore requesting a report, consider how it may affect your safety.\n\n# Questions to consider\n\n* Could the abusive person find out you requested it?\n* Where will you store the report?\n* Do you share devices, accounts, or email access?\n* Are you being pressured to get or share the report?\n\n# Safety tips\n\n* Use a safe phone or secure device\n* Ask an advocate to help store or print it for you\n* Use a safe mailing address or PO box\n* Call 911 if you are in immediate danger\n\nAdvocates in Alaska offer confidential support and are not part of law enforcement.\n\n# 4. Step-by-step: How to request a police report in Alaska\n\n# Step 1: Identify the responding agency\n\nLook for:\n\n* Officer uniform or badge\n* Paperwork (case number, business card)\n* The number you called (local police or State Troopers)\n\nCommon agencies include:\n\n* Anchorage PD\n* Fairbanks PD\n* Juneau PD\n* Local city/borough police\n* Alaska State Troopers\n\nIf unsure, call the local non-emergency number for help.\n\n# Step 2: Contact the Records Division\n\nYou can usually:\n\n* Call the department’s non-emergency line\n* Visit the website\n* Ask for “Records” or “Public Records”\n\nAsk:\n\n* “How do I request a copy as a domestic violence victim?”\n* “Is there a form?”\n* “Can I request online, by mail, or in person?”\n* “Is there a fee?”\n* “Do I need to show ID?”\n\n# Step 3: Submit your request\n\nYou may need to provide:\n\n* Your name and contact info\n* Your role (victim, witness)\n* Case number\n* Date and location of the incident\n* Names of people involved\n\nSome agencies allow:\n\n* Online requests\n* Email requests\n* Mail-in requests\n* In-person requests\n\nIf you feel unsafe going in person, you can say:\n\n&gt;\n\n# Step 4: Pay any fees\n\nAsk:\n\n* How much the report costs\n* What payment types are accepted\n* Whether fees can be waived for victims\n\nAdvocacy programs or legal aid may help if cost is a barrier.\n\n# Step 5: Wait for processing\n\nYou may receive:\n\n* A full report\n* A redacted report\n* A partial or denied request (especially if the case is open)\n\nIf denied, you can ask for a written explanation and talk to a lawyer about alternatives.\n\n# 5. Getting information through the prosecutor or your lawyer\n\n# Victim-witness assistance\n\nDistrict attorneys have victim-witness staff who can:\n\n* Explain the criminal process\n* Share information about hearings and the case\n* Review parts of the report with you\n\nThey may not provide a full copy if there are safety or investigation concerns.\n\n# Your own lawyer\n\nA lawyer can often:\n\n* Request the report directly\n* Access criminal case discovery\n* Use the report in civil cases\n\nLawyers typically have access that individuals do not.\n\n# 6. What if the case is still under investigation?\n\nWhile cases are open, agencies may restrict access.\n\nYou might be told:\n\n* The report is not available yet\n* Only a partial/redacted copy can be provided\n\nYour options:\n\n* Explain why you need it (e.g., protective order hearing)\n* Request a summary or confirmation letter\n* Ask a lawyer to request it\n* Seek help from an advocate\n\n# 7. What might be redacted or withheld?\n\nCommon redactions include:\n\n* Addresses and phone numbers\n* Names of witnesses\n* Information about children\n* Sensitive third-party details\n* Certain parts of your own statement\n\nIf unsure, you can ask Records what was redacted and why. Advocates and lawyers can help review it safely.\n\n# 8. Using a police report in Alaska protective orders, custody, or divorce cases\n\n# Protective orders (restraining orders)\n\nA police report may help support:\n\n* Your account of what happened\n* Your need for protection\n\nBut you **do not** need a police report to get a protective order. A sworn statement can be enough.\n\n# Custody and parenting time\n\nJudges must consider domestic violence when deciding custody.\n\nPolice reports may:\n\n* Show history of incidents\n* Support requests for safety-related restrictions\n\n# Divorce and property cases\n\nReports may help explain safety issues that impact living arrangements or communication.\n\n# 9. If you are the one charged in the case\n\nSometimes survivors are arrested or charged.\n\nIf you are the defendant:\n\n* You have a right to a lawyer\n* Your lawyer can request the report and all evidence\n* Public defenders are available if you qualify\n\nDo **not** request the report on your own — talk with your lawyer first.\n\n# 10. Common emotional reactions to reading the report\n\nMany survivors feel:\n\n* Shock\n* Anger\n* Shame (even though the abuse is not your fault)\n* Fear\n* Relief\n\nYou can:\n\n* Read it with support\n* Take breaks\n* Choose not to read every detail\n\nRemember: police reports rarely capture the full story.\n\n# 11. Where to get help in Alaska\n\nYou can contact:\n\n* Local DV shelters and advocacy programs\n* Alaska legal aid organizations\n* Private attorneys familiar with DV, family law, or criminal law\n\nAdvocates can help you:\n\n* Request the report\n* Navigate police or court processes\n* Safety plan around documentation\n\n# 12. Key takeaways\n\n* Victims can often request DV police reports in Alaska, but access may be limited if the case is open.\n* Requests usually go through the Records Division of the responding agency.\n* Parts of the report may be redacted for privacy.\n* Prosecutors and lawyers may also help you access information.\n* Safety planning is crucial — the abusive person may later see the report through court processes.\n* You are not alone; advocates and lawyers can support you.\n\n# Frequently Asked Questions\n\n# Can I get a copy of a domestic violence police report if I’m the victim?\n\nOften yes, but limits apply if the case is under investigation or contains sensitive information. Agencies may release only a redacted or summary version.\n\n# How do I request a report from Alaska State Troopers or local police?\n\nIdentify the responding agency, contact their Records Division, ask for their process, and submit the required information.\n\n# What if the report isn’t available yet?\n\nYou may need to wait until the investigation progresses. You can request a summary or ask a lawyer to help.\n\n# Do I need a police report to get a protective order?\n\nNo. Your sworn statement may be enough, but a police report can help if available.\n\n# Will the abusive person see the report?\n\nThey may see it later through criminal or family court, not because you asked for a copy. Safety planning is important.\n\n# Can I get the report if I was arrested?\n\nYes — through your lawyer. Public defenders can help if you qualify.\n\n# How much does it cost?\n\nFees vary by agency. Ask Records about their fee schedule and whether victims qualify for waivers.\n\n# Will my address be visible?\n\nSome personal details may appear but can often be redacted upon request.",

    "title": "How to Get a Copy of a Police Report After Domestic Violence in Alabama",
    "selftext": "*This article provides general legal information, not legal advice. Laws change and every situation is different. Talk to a lawyer in Alabama for advice about your specific situation.*\n\nExperiencing domestic violence is traumatic, and dealing with the legal system afterward can feel overwhelming. If the police responded to an incident in Alabama, they likely created a police report. That report can be important for safety planning, court cases, immigration matters, housing, and more.\n\nThis guide explains, in plain language, how to request a copy of a domestic violence police report in Alabama, what to expect, and how to think about safety and privacy as you move forward.\n\n# 1. What is a police report in a domestic violence case?\n\nWhen law enforcement responds to a domestic violence call in Alabama, the officer usually completes an incident report or offense report. It generally includes:\n\n* Date, time, and location\n* Names of people involved\n* Statements from you, the abusive person, and witnesses\n* Officer observations\n* Any visible injuries or property damage\n* Whether an arrest was made\n* Any weapons involved\n\nThe report becomes part of official agency records and may be forwarded to the prosecutor.\n\nPolice reports are generally public records in Alabama, but there are important exceptions—especially involving domestic violence, minors, or ongoing investigations.\n\n# 2. Why you might want a copy of the police report\n\nSurvivors often request police reports for many reasons, including:\n\n* **Protection From Abuse (PFA) orders**\n* **Criminal case information**\n* **Family court or custody cases**\n* **Immigration cases** (VAWA, U visas, etc.)\n* **Housing or employment issues**\n* **Personal records**\n\nIt is understandable to want this information. You can move at your own pace.\n\n# 3. Safety first: Things to consider before requesting a report\n\nRequesting a report can sometimes increase risk if the abusive person becomes aware of it.\n\n# 3.1 Questions to ask yourself\n\n* Does the abusive person know I might take legal steps?\n* Do we still live together?\n* Has the abusive person reacted badly in the past?\n* Could mail or email be accessed by them?\n\n# 3.2 Safety planning around the request\n\nConsider:\n\n* Using a safe mailing address\n* Using a private, secure email\n* Calling from a safe phone\n* Asking an advocate or lawyer for help\n\nDomestic violence advocates in Alabama can assist with safety planning around record requests.\n\nIf you are in immediate danger, call 911.\n\n# 4. Who can get a copy of a domestic violence police report in Alabama?\n\nAccess is shaped by public records law and agency policy.\n\n# 4.1 Typical people who may request a report\n\n* The victim/survivor\n* The accused person\n* Lawyers\n* Insurance companies (with authorization)\n* Other agencies\n\nSometimes only a **redacted** version or **summary** is available.\n\n# 4.2 Limits on access\n\nYou may face limits if:\n\n* The case is still under investigation\n* Minors are involved\n* The report contains sensitive information\n* A court has sealed the records\n\nIf denied, you can ask:\n\n* “Can I have a victim copy or redacted copy?”\n* “Is there a summary available?”\n\n# 5. Step-by-step: How to request a police report in Alabama\n\nThe process varies by agency (police, sheriff, or state troopers).\n\n# 5.1 Step 1: Identify the law enforcement agency\n\nIt may be:\n\n* A city police department\n* A county sheriff’s office\n* Alabama Law Enforcement Agency (ALEA)\n\nCheck for:\n\n* Officer business cards\n* Case numbers\n* Victim information sheets\n\nIf unsure, call the non-emergency number for that city/county.\n\n# 5.2 Step 2: Gather basic information\n\nHelpful information:\n\n* Your full name\n* Date of the incident\n* Location\n* Name of the abusive person\n* Case or incident number\n\nProvide what you can—clerks can often search by name and date.\n\n# 5.3 Step 3: Contact the records or public information office\n\nYou can:\n\n* Call the non-emergency number\n* Visit the website\n* Ask about the process, required forms, fees, and timelines\n\nQuestions to ask:\n\n* “How do I request a copy as the victim?”\n* “Do you offer online or mail-in requests?”\n\n# 5.4 Step 4: Submit your request\n\n# In person\n\n* Bring ID\n* Complete forms\n* Pay fees\n\n# By mail\n\nInclude:\n\n* Your name and contact information\n* Your role as the victim\n* Date/location/case number\n* Copy of ID (if required)\n* Fee\n\n# Online or email\n\nSome agencies allow online forms, ID uploads, and digital payments.\n\n# 5.5 Step 5: Wait for processing\n\nTimelines vary—some may take days or weeks, especially if redaction is needed.\n\n# 5.6 Step 6: Pick up or receive the report\n\nYou might:\n\n* Pick it up with ID\n* Receive it by mail\n* Receive it electronically\n\nRedactions are normal.\n\n# 6. What if the agency refuses to give you the report?\n\nCommon reasons for denial:\n\n* Active investigation\n* Involvement of minors\n* Sensitive information\n* Safety concerns\n\nIf denied:\n\n1. **Ask for clarification**\n   * “Why can’t I receive a copy?”\n   * “Is a redacted or summary copy available?”\n2. **Ask about appeal or review**\n3. **Talk to a lawyer**\n   * They may obtain it through legal processes.\n4. **Work with a victim advocate**\n   * Advocates often assist with communication and records access.\n\n# 7. Using a police report in Alabama legal processes\n\nA police report is just one piece of evidence.\n\n# 7.1 PFAs (Protection From Abuse orders)\n\nA report can:\n\n* Support your request\n* Provide dates and officer observations\n\nYou do not need a police report to request a PFA.\n\n# 7.2 Criminal cases\n\nIf charges are filed:\n\n* Prosecutors and defense lawyers get copies\n* Advocates can explain what it means\n* You may still need to testify\n\n# 7.3 Family law and custody\n\nA police report can support:\n\n* Safety concerns\n* Requests for supervised visitation\n\nJudges consider multiple sources of evidence.\n\n# 8. Privacy and confidentiality concerns\n\n# 8.1 What information might appear?\n\nReports may include:\n\n* Your name\n* Address\n* Phone numbers\n* Names of children\n* Your statements\n\nIf worried, ask about redactions.\n\n# 8.2 Who may see the report?\n\nDepending on the situation:\n\n* Prosecutors\n* Defense attorneys\n* Judges\n* Child protective services\n* Immigration officials (with your consent)\n* Insurance companies\n\nAsk a lawyer or advocate if you have concerns about privacy.\n\n# 9. Emotional impact of reading the report\n\nReading the report can:\n\n* Trigger memories\n* Feel incomplete\n* Feel cold or clinical\n\nThis is normal. Police reports are not full narratives.\n\nConsider:\n\n* Reading it with support\n* Taking breaks\n* Reminding yourself it is just one document\n\n# 10. Getting help in Alabama\n\nYou can seek support from:\n\n* Domestic violence shelters\n* Legal aid organizations\n* Private attorneys\n* Victim advocates in prosecutors’ offices\n\nA hotline can help direct you to local resources.\n\n# 11. Key takeaways\n\n* You can usually request a DV police report in Alabama from the responding agency.\n* Limits may apply (investigations, minors, redactions).\n* Reports can help in PFAs, custody, immigration, and criminal cases.\n* Safety and privacy should guide how you request and receive reports.\n* You have the right to support and clear information.\n\n# Frequently Asked Questions\n\n# Can I get a copy of a domestic violence police report if I’m the victim?\n\nUsually yes, though redactions or limitations may apply.\n\n# How much does it cost?\n\nFees vary by agency; some offer a free victim copy.\n\n# How long does it take?\n\nAnywhere from the same day to several weeks.\n\n# What if police refuse to give it to me?\n\nAsk for reasons, request a redacted copy, appeal, or get help from a lawyer/advocate.\n\n# Will the abusive person know I requested it?\n\nNot usually, but risks vary—talk to an advocate if concerned.\n\n# Do I need a police report for a PFA?\n\nNo, but it can help.\n\n# Will my address be visible?\n\nOften yes—ask about redaction.\n\n# Can I request the report if I moved out of state?\n\nYes. Most agencies accept mail, email, or online requests.",

    "selftext": "Text translation: \nAround the “FLN treasure”\n\nThis complicated story still hasn’t revealed all its secrets. How much was this treasure worth? What became of it?\n\nIn the beginning, according to François Genoud, 42 million Swiss francs were deposited at the BCA:\n\n— 10 were used for the capital increase dating from 1964;\n— 2 were transferred to a numbered account in Algeria;\n— 6 went to Aït Ahmed;\n— 6 to Boudia, who took Moussa’s share without telling him (Boudia only sent him 200,000 French francs);\n— Bitat, Lebjaoui and Khider each recovered a share;\n— more than 3 million were deposited in cash by Khider at the BPA;\n— a portion was used, as we saw, to pay for weapons intended for the maquis in Kabylia.\n\nThe famous “FLN treasure” stirred much greed, hatred and violence. A lot of blood was spilled over this stash. Because the Algerian authorities feared those who possessed it, fully or partially. Because those who believed they were entitled to a share felt they had been cheated…\n\nMiloud Brahimi remembers, for example, that Khider offered him the share he had reserved for Moussa. He then advised Khider to approach Boudia instead, to act as intermediary. He knew perfectly well that Boudia later received Moussa’s share, and he was the witness, a few months later, to a violent dispute between the two men in front of the Hôtel d’Angleterre in Ouchy:\n\n— “You betrayed me!” Moussa shouted at Boudia.",

    "title": "South Park was so much better when the kids acted like kids",
    "selftext": "I copied and pasted this from r/changemyview\n\nOne of my gripes with modern South Park is how the characters (mainly the kids) aren't really written as people. I watched clips of the new Turkey Trot episode (the recent Thanksgiving special) and just went \"Okay, I get it, Pete Hegseth is an asshole, but why should I care?\" The characters felt less like actual people and just *vehicles* Matt and Trey were using to make a point. And then I realized that South Park has always been like that. Sure, there are some character-driven episodes, but those don't happen often for a reason. The selling point of South Park has always been its social/political commentary, and its characters were always a means to that end.\n\nNow, don’t get me wrong, I can and will acknowledge that the show has always had social commentary from the very beginning. But even then, some episodes shied away from that and focused solely on the kids being kids (Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society, Casa Bonita, Raisins, Marjorine, The List, Free Willzyx, AWESOME-O, Cartman’s Incredible Gift, etc.). I really like these because we see what the characters usually do when they aren't being used to cover whatever was in the news that week. While Matt and Trey may have had a point or been satirizing a particular thing, the topic was not always the sole focus of the episode. The topics also tended to be about broader trends in culture, which generally tend to age better. Unfortunately, we rarely get that.\n\nRealistic storylines where they’re just playing World of Warcraft, making lemon bars, naively tricked into believing that a whale is talking to them, or just trying to get the cootie catcher from the girls because they don’t understand the concept of it, are honestly adorable to me. Situations that remind me that they’re children, such as tricking a guy into selling them ninja weapons and slipping into a fantasy world or accidentally stumbling across their parents’ porn, on the other hand, tend to be my favorite storylines.\n\nSure, the ridiculousness of Cartman feeding Scott with his parents as chili or giving Kyle AIDS is hilarious, but there’s something a little special about the ability to remind the audience of an adult show as to who the characters actually are deep down behind all of the violence, swearing, and lewd humor.\n\nNowadays, the kids seem to act more like adults or teenagers than anything. Plus, characters will just change to suit whatever the plot demands. Season 20 is a perfect example. They wanted to cover the 2016 US presidential election, but made several big character changes (Gerald becoming an irredeemable douchebag and Cartman and Butters swapping personalities, to name a few). And they had to hastily rewrite the last 4 episodes because the election didn't go the way they planned, which the entire season was banking on. So all the unbearable things in this season either got resolved in a shitty way (Gerald getting away scot-free with his trolling) or didn't get resolved at all (What happened with the Member Berries exactly? What was the deal with *Star Wars* and J.J. Abrams? Did the feud between the boys and girls at South Park Elementary get solved?).\n\nTo end things on a positive note, I find the games way better in terms of characterization and writing. The plots of Stick of Truth, The Fractured But Whole, and the rest of the episodes I mentioned in the second paragraph are just the kids being kids without having it be a commentary or allegory for something in the real world. I just found Kyle and Wendy (who I don't entirely vibe with due to being mouthpieces for the creators’ opinions) so much more fun.\n\nTLDR: South Park is better when the kids act like kids, but Matt and Trey don't want that",

    "selftext": "**Book Four: The Circle- Part 13**\n\n \n\nBuck and Birch spent the night with the carriage, sleeping within a large tent meant for long journeys. The only Lodge nearby was the McIntosh Lodge, and Birch of course resolutely refused to go anywhere near it. The Lodge was also too far away and obviously unoccupied regardless. The carriage was cramped, but they made it work. It would likely be late afternoon or evening by the time they reached Vale.\n\n \n\nBuck wanted to ask Birch how his family had been doing, though the man had already made it fairly clear that abandoning them had very badly hurt them. He repeated Wren and Sky’s words to himself.\n\n \n\n*They’re going to be so happy to see me again.*\n\n \n\n*No parent would ever want to give up a kid like me.*\n\n \n\nBut Birch’s attitude towards him was beginning to shake his belief in those words. If Birch was taking him home, it was very likely he had not been disowned. But at the same time he wondered how his father would really feel about his return. Would he be bitter, like Birch is being?\n\n \n\nHe remembered how Boulder had reacted to him almost dying at the Academy of Humanities and Sciences. He had never seen him so angry, so scared of what almost happened to him. Then when he was crying above him at the Lodge. He had blamed himself for losing him, wondering if something he had done had pushed him away.\n\n \n\n*No… it was all my fault.*\n\n \n\nBuck noticed that a newspaper had been placed on the seat next to him, which had somehow escaped his notice since the beginning of the ride. It was a copy of a paper called the “Haven Journal-Eternal.” The headline at the top of the front page read “Preparations Continue for War.” Buck skimmed the first couple paragraphs.\n\n \n\n*Our Savior the Last will save us once again.*\n\n \n\n*He has promised us an eternity without suffering.*\n\n \n\n*He will guide us to a glorious future for humankind.*\n\n \n\n“The Golden Nightmare,” Buck whispered. The Last was hell-bent on eradicating the dragons and ushering in a new era of humanity with him at the very top. It was as much as Elm told him. But strangely, besides showing him how Omega lost his daughter, Alpha had not told him anything about the Last’s plans.\n\n \n\n*Wouldn’t knowing the plans of my supposed enemy be kind of important?*\n\n \n\nAnother hour passed, and eventually, Birch stopped to take lunch out of the carriage’s storage compartment. It was the same as yesterday’s dinner; corned beef sandwiches. As they ate, and as the horses had their fill of grain, Buck looked over at Birch, and finally got the courage to ask the question.\n\n \n\n“How is my family really feeling?”\n\n \n\nBirch swallowed, looked away, and then looked back at him, his eyes empty. “It was horrifying to watch. Boulder, Bailey… they both started to waste away knowing you were gone. They would go multiple days without sleeping. They started skipping meals until people had to start forcing them to eat. One of the watchtower guards had to take over running the town because Boulder was virtually unable to function as a person. Bailey cries almost daily.”\n\n \n\nBuck in turn began to *feel* empty. “I did this to them.”  \n\n\nBirch grunted. “Yes. You did. You had your reasons, but I think you will find your reunion with your family to be much harder than fighting a dragon.”\n\n \n\n“Well, I guess there’s no better time to return to them than now.”\n\n \n\n“Correct. You have kept them worrying for long enough.”\n\n \n\nWith their meal finished, Buck got back into the carriage and Birch resumed the journey. Almost immediately, Birch spoke up again.\n\n \n\n“He made you a gun.”\n\n \n\nBuck sighed. “Yeah. It’s what I needed to kill the Scourge.”\n\n \n\n“You never used it on a person?”\n\n \n\n“I almost used it on Redwood. But Elm stopped me.”\n\n \n\nBirch scoffed. “That is unlike him.”\n\n \n\n“He’s a more responsible teacher than you gave him credit for.”\n\n \n\n“Maybe. But it doesn’t excuse what he did to you before.”\n\n \n\n“I think it’s my choice whether to forgive him for that.”\n\n \n\nSurprisingly, Birch laughed. “Yes, I suppose it is. My apologies for that.”\n\n \n\nThe woods began to grow warmer as they traveled. Buck did not know how far into winter they were, but perhaps spring was coming early. It could also be warmer air from the Rainforest Kingdom blowing into the East Hills region. This was known to occasionally happen.\n\n \n\nThe carriage eventually merged onto a wider road. To his right he saw something which shocked him and made him feel quite melancholic. Down the road in the distance was the Mountain Bridge Tunnel. While he could not see it from here, he knew that Elm’s Lodge which he had called home for several months was there next to it.\n\n \n\n*Hopefully Elm can keep that place when he’s free,* Buck wished, *And hopefully he’ll do okay in prison.* He wondered if he would ever get a chance to see him again.\n\n \n\nThis in turn made Buck realize that for the foreseeable future, his adventures were over. Soon, he would be back in Vale, and he would likely stay there with his family until he reached adulthood. This made him even more melancholic. No more classes with dragons, no more flights to Wayfarer’s Island. No more life-or-death clashes with dragons, alligators, maniacal researchers. He would return to the life of a villager in the hills, surrounded by loving family but devoid of any enrichment to his life.\n\n \n\nBuck sighed. He remembered his father’s words months ago. *You are still a child, Buck. You need a sheltered place to grow, not to be constantly roaming like you have been.* Buck had seen more adventure than likely anyone of his age in recent history. Not even Wren had had this much fun, he thought. But now that it was all over…\n\n \n\n*Well, let’s focus on reuniting with my family first.*\n\n \n\nIt would only be a matter of time. He vaguely remembered how long the journey from Vale to the Lodge had taken. It was likely two hours or less before he got home. Again, this gave Buck a strange feeling. He had not seen Vale since leaving for Jade Mountain Academy. So much had changed since then that he was practically an entirely new person.\n\n \n\n*Perhaps that’s what adventuring does to a person. It changes them.*\n\n \n\n“Buck,” Birch said an hour later from the driver’s seat, “You’re going to want to see this.”\n\n \n\nBuck poked his head out of the carriage’s window and immediately gasped. There was a large banner spread between the trees, with a clearly-painted message on it.\n\n \n\n**Please come home, Buck!**\n\n \n\nBuck had to restrain a tear from his eye. They left this message here where anyone entering the village could see it. They wanted apparently the entire world to know that they missed him.\n\n \n\nBuck sighed to repress a sob, and he then saw Bulrush’s face pop out of the bushes at the side of the road. The dragon gave him a questioning look, to which Buck gave him a thumbs-up in response. He was home.\n\n \n\nSoon the first buildings appeared. First the hunter’s cabins. Then the guards’ homes, where his own house once stood. Finally they entered the town proper and were surrounded by houses, with the farms and garden plots laid out on the hill beneath the town.\n\n \n\nThe carriage came to a stop, and Buck did not want to wait any longer. He pushed open the door of the carriage and dropped to the ground, savoring the feel of Vale’s land beneath his feet. Multiple townspeople, including the seamstress carrying her two infant children, gaped upon seeing him, their eyes wide and pupils narrow.\n\n \n\nBuck, in a daze, took two steps away from the carriage, his breathing deep and heavy. Everyone was looking at him. Even the hunters’ dogs, seemingly noticing a shift in atmosphere, gazed at him silently.\n\n \n\nThen he saw Bailey. She was standing in front of the well. She seemed to pick up on the shift herself, and turned to see him. Her eyes went wide and white, and seemingly in a trance she approached her brother, her body wobbling from side to side.\n\n \n\nWhen she reached Buck, she stayed in front of him, her whole body shivering.\n\n \n\n“Uh…” Buck said, “Hey, Baile—”\n\n \n\nBuck felt his face get slapped so hard it instantly went numb in a flash of white-hot pain, and his head reflexively snapped to the right, his eyes wincing. But he turned to see Bailey again, to see her shaking even harder. She lifted her hand to her eyes, staring at it for a moment, then resumed staring at Buck, and she ran a violently shaking hand over the raw, stinging skin of his cheek, tears beginning to flow from her eyes.\n\n \n\nJust as quickly as he had been slapped by her, she rushed into a deep hug with him, peals of pitched sobbing erupting from her chest, her whole body jumping with each sob.\n\n \n\n“Buck… Buck…” Bailey sobbed, her words barely legible through her crying.\n\n \n\nBuck momentarily shifted his gaze away from his sister to see Patience emerge from Buck’s house, soon noticing the two of them. His jaw dropped, and he shook.\n\n \n\n“Holy shit… Boulder!” he shouted back into the house, “Come out here, quick!”\n\n \n\nPatience then ran from the house over to them. Boulder then took his place inside the door. For just a moment, Buck almost did not recognize him. His eyes were empty and sunk into their sockets, his face too pale. But as soon as he laid eyes on Buck, he transformed, restoring his energy in a flash as he took two shaky steps forward, trying still to confirm what he was seeing.\n\n \n\n“By the moons…” his father breathed, “BUCK!!”  \n\n\nBoulder almost pranced over to the group, and soon joined Bailey and Patience in a group hug, Buck buried on all sides in embracing arms. Bailey continued to cry, though her pitch had shifted, seemingly crying now out of joy. He felt multiple tears drop from Boulder’s face onto his shoulder.\n\n \n\nThe group hug continued for more than three minutes, before Birch stepped off of the driver’s seat, his eyes leery, but still betraying the relief he felt deep down.\n\n \n\n“Buck,” Birch warned, “You better give them an explanation.”\n\n \n\nBuck’s family let go of him. “Right, right,” Buck said, “I, uh…”\n\n \n\n“We should go inside,” Boulder said, tears of joy leaving multiple tracks down his cheeks. “A long talk is best shared while sitting down.”\n\n \n\nBuck had not seen the inside of his home in almost three-quarters of a year. The fireplace currently held a pot of stew cooking. Based on the smell, it was a chicken stew with beans. But on the table was something which shocked Buck. It was a large cake, though it had become sagged and its icing runny. There had not been a single piece taken out of it.\n\n \n\n*They didn’t even eat my birthday cake… They were waiting for me that long…* This made Buck feel even worse about himself.\n\n \n\nSoon, everyone sat down. He had his father and sister on either side of him, while Patience and Birch sat across from him.\n\n \n\n“First,” Buck said, “I’m *so* sorry, about everything.”\n\n \n\nBoulder nodded. “You are home now, Buck. That matters the most to me.”\n\n \n\n“So, the reason I left you… was so I could train to kill the Scourge.”\n\n \n\nBailey gasped. “You went to fight that monster *alone!?* You could have—”\n\n \n\n“Bailey,” Boulder gestured to his daughter to calm down. “He has clearly survived.”\n\n \n\n“Yeah,” Buck continued, “And thanks to me, the Scourge is dead now.”\n\n \n\nPatience rubbed his forehead. “Thank the *moons* for that.”\n\n \n\nBoulder gestured to a newspaper. “I saw that the Scourge had been killed. A traveling merchant brought this from Haven today. I did not think to read it yet… But I believe we should look now.”\n\n \n\nThe paper was opened to show the front page article in full. In massive bold text on the top front was the headline, highlighting its importance. Buck read the article along with his family.\n\n \n\n**SCOURGE DEAD**\n\n \n\n***Dragon terrorist slain by young hero***\n\n \n\n**The Scourge, a dragon responsible for widespread death and destruction across the human territories of Pyrrhia, has been killed.**\n\n \n\n**The slayer of the Scourge has been identified as 14-year-old Buck from the East Hills region. Examinations of the Scourge's body identify an unlikely culprit for her demise: fire-sac blockage. Her body catastrophically exploded, making death all but certain. The exact weapon with which the killing was carried out is currently unknown.**\n\n \n\n**The Scourge quickly rose to infamy over the past year, appearing seemingly out of nowhere to attack multiple human settlements resulting in thousands of losses. Her violence culminated with an attack on Jade Mountain Academy, which had been teaching its first class of human students alongside dragons. The carnage was largely brought to an end by an undisclosed student exercising Animus abilities, though one student, 13-year-old Badger of Pine Run, died from injuries resulting from the attack. Many dragons have expressed horror with the Scourge’s violence, and Badger's funeral in Pine Run was attended by several dragons, including Prince Winter of the IceWings as well as the tribe’s Queen Snowfall.**\n\n \n\n**The Joint Interspecies Council on the Scourge released a statement regarding the dragon's death.**\n\n \n\n**\"We of the Council, both humans and dragons, have breathed a collective sigh of relief. The Scourge, a dragon who plagued our shared nightmares for the past year, is no more. The Kingdoms of Pyrrhia offer their deepest thanks to young Buck, and wish him success in his future.\"**\n\n \n\n**Buck's current whereabouts are being withheld for the sake of his privacy. The Scourge's body has been donated to the Academy of Humanities and Sciences, to be studied in the interest in discovering anatomical differences between Proto-Dragons and the present day tribes. Victims of the Scourge, including bereaved families, can also claim life assistance packages from the Human Reparations Fund being pooled by the dragon royalty.**\n\n \n\n***Coverage by Sycamore of Haven, senior reporter for The Haven Journal-Eternal.***\n\n \n\n“Three moons,” Boulder said, “My son left me as a boy… and has returned to me as a man.”\n\n \n\nBuck blushed. “Well, Elm helped me train and all…”\n\n \n\n“You have grown, Buck. It is strange of me to think this, but you truly have grown so much under Elm. I believe I may have miscalculated my opinion of him.”\n\n \n\n“Ahem,” Birch said, “Even if Buck did go with him willingly, this still massively affected you.”\n\n \n\n“I know,” Boulder said, his eyes glistening, “But look at Buck. He has become a hero, Birch. Truly time away from us well spent.”\n\n \n\nBirch growled and lowered his head. “You’d be thinking very differently if the Scourge *had* killed him.”\n\n \n\nBoulder himself seemed to dim slightly. “That has not happened, of course.” he turned and patted Buck on the shoulder. “I am very proud of you, Buck.”\n\n \n\nBailey shifted. “So you did this… for Badger?”\n\n \n\n“For all of us.”\n\n \n\nShe sighed, and flicked some hair away from her eyes, before looking at his gun strapped to his back.\n\n \n\n“You, uh… didn’t hurt yourself with that again, did you?”\n\n \n\n“The strap helps,” Buck explained.\n\n \n\n“And he *claims* he hasn’t used it on any people,” Birch said.\n\n \n\n“That’s good,” Patience said, “Have to say, that thing is just plain overkill for anything besides dragons anyway.”\n\n \n\n“Anyway,” Bailey said, “What else did you do?”\n\n \n\n“*So* much. I got to visit Sala on…” He remembered that he was keeping a secret for her. “His island. We got to save him and his island from a dragon attack by Bulrush’s brother. I also met Ahi again. She’s kind of different now, having learned the truth about what people go through because of dragons.”\n\n \n\n“Speaking of Bulrush,” Boulder said, “Where is he now?”\n\n \n\n“Somewhere around Vale,” Buck responded, “I saw him on my way in.”\n\n \n\n“You said Bulrush’s brother almost killed Sala,” Bailey said, “Is he…?”\n\n \n\n“He’s on the Scourge’s side, but Bulrush also doesn’t want me to kill him. He thinks he can get through to him somehow.”\n\n \n\n“Still,” Boulder said, “Perhaps it is best that you hold onto your weapon.”\n\n \n\n“Seriously?” Birch said, “You’re going to let him keep that thing?”\n\n \n\n“I trust my son. Additionally, we will need a way to defend ourselves, if in fact hostile dragons still roam.”\n\n \n\n“That’s… logical, I suppose.”\n\n \n\n“In any case,” Boulder continued, “With Buck returned to us, I believe a celebration is in order.”\n\n \n\n“YES!” Bailey shouted, pumping her fists, “We gotta celebrate Buck’s birthday after all!”\n\n \n\n“Give or take several months,” Patience mumbled.\n\n \n\n“We will need a new cake,” Boulder said, “I will go to the baker.”\n\n \n\n“I’ll keep watch on the stew!” Bailey said.\n\n \n\n“And Buck,” Boulder said, standing. “You stay here. Rest here, at home.”\n\n \n\n“Understood,” Buck said.\n\n ",

    "title": "Child Custody and Domestic Violence in Alabama: A Survivor’s Guide",
    "selftext": "This article provides general legal information, not legal advice. Laws change and every situation is different. Talk to a lawyer in Alabama for advice about your specific situation.\n\n\n\n# Understanding Child Custody and Domestic Violence in Alabama\n\nIf you are living with domestic violence or have left an abusive relationship, it is completely understandable to worry about what will happen with your children. Many survivors stay longer or return to unsafe situations because they are afraid of losing custody or being forced into unsafe visitation.\n\nIn Alabama, courts must consider domestic or family violence when making child custody and visitation decisions. This guide explains how that works, what judges look at, and what options you may have to help protect yourself and your children.\n\nThis information is meant to empower you with knowledge. It is not your fault that abuse is happening or has happened. You deserve safety and support.\n\n\n\n# Key Terms in Alabama Child Custody Cases\n\nBefore diving into how domestic violence affects custody, it helps to understand some basic terms used in Alabama family courts.\n\n# Legal custody vs. physical custody\n\n**Legal custody**: The right to make major decisions about a child, such as:\n\n* Education\n* Medical care\n* Religious upbringing\n* Major activities\n\n**Physical custody**: Where the child lives most of the time.\n\nAlabama courts can award:\n\n* **Sole legal custody** – One parent makes major decisions.\n* **Joint legal custody** – Parents share decision-making.\n* **Sole physical custody** – Child primarily lives with one parent.\n* **Joint physical custody** – Child spends significant time with each parent (not necessarily 50/50).\n\n# Visitation (parenting time)\n\nVisitation (sometimes called “parenting time”) refers to time with the parent who does not have primary physical custody. In domestic violence cases, visitation may be:\n\n* Unsupervised\n* Supervised\n* Limited\n* Restricted or denied (rare)\n\n\n\n# How Alabama Law Treats Domestic Violence in Custody Cases\n\nAlabama law specifically addresses domestic or family violence in custody decisions. The court’s main focus is always **the best interests of the child**.\n\n# Domestic or family violence creates a presumption\n\nIf the court finds that a parent has committed domestic or family violence, there is a **rebuttable presumption** that giving that parent:\n\n* Sole or joint physical custody, or\n* Sole or joint legal custody\n\nis **not** in the child’s best interest.\n\n# What counts as domestic or family violence?\n\nAlabama law considers a range of abusive behaviors, including:\n\n* Physical harm\n* Threats\n* Stalking or harassment\n* Certain criminal offenses\n\nYou do **not** need a criminal conviction. The judge may consider:\n\n* PFA orders\n* Police reports\n* Medical records\n* Witness statements\n* Your testimony\n\n# The child’s exposure matters\n\nCourts consider whether a child:\n\n* Witnessed violence\n* Heard threats or incidents\n* Was used as a tool to control the survivor\n* Was directly harmed or threatened\n\nExposure alone can affect custody decisions.\n\n\n\n# Best Interests of the Child in Alabama\n\nJudges consider many factors when determining the child’s best interests, such as:\n\n* Safety and stability of each home\n* History of violence\n* Parent–child relationships\n* Physical, emotional, and educational needs\n* Substance abuse or mental health concerns\n* Willingness to support a healthy relationship with the other parent (except where unsafe)\n\nDomestic violence can impact all of these factors.\n\n\n\n# How Domestic Violence Can Affect Custody Outcomes\n\n# 1. Limits on custody for the abusive parent\n\nThe court may:\n\n* Deny joint custody\n* Award sole legal/physical custody to the survivor\n* Require supervised visitation\n* Limit overnight visits\n* Require safe exchange locations\n\n# 2. Safety-focused visitation orders\n\nConditions may include:\n\n* Supervised visits\n* No substance use\n* No overnights\n* Safe exchange locations\n* No direct contact between parents\n\n# 3. Considering abusive behavior in decisions\n\nJudges may evaluate whether the abusive parent has:\n\n* Completed intervention programs\n* Followed court/PFA orders\n* Addressed substance use or mental health issues\n* Stopped abusive behavior\n\nProgram completion does **not** guarantee custody.\n\n\n\n# Protection From Abuse (PFA) Orders and Temporary Custody\n\nA PFA in Alabama can include temporary custody and visitation terms.\n\n# How a PFA helps\n\nA PFA may:\n\n* Grant temporary custody\n* Set supervised visitation\n* Order stay-away provisions\n* Establish safe exchange rules\n\nThese are temporary but important safety tools.\n\n# Getting a PFA in Alabama\n\nYou can request a PFA:\n\n* At your county courthouse\n* Through a shelter or advocacy group\n* With a lawyer’s help\n\nEmergency (ex parte) PFAs may be issued first, followed by a full hearing.\n\n\n\n# Evidence of Domestic Violence in Custody Cases\n\nYou do **not** need proof beyond a reasonable doubt. Helpful evidence can include:\n\n* PFA orders\n* Police reports\n* Medical records\n* Photos\n* Messages (texts, emails, social media)\n* Voicemails/recordings (Alabama is generally one-party consent—check with a lawyer)\n* Witness statements\n* School/daycare records\n\n# Safety first\n\nIf gathering evidence puts you at risk:\n\n* Use a safe device\n* Store copies with trusted people\n* Use secure cloud storage\n\n\n\n# Step-by-Step: How a Custody Case May Work in Alabama\n\n# 1. Filing a case\n\nCustody may be decided in:\n\n* Divorce\n* Paternity/custody action\n* Modification\n* PFA case\n\n# 2. Temporary (pendente lite) orders\n\nThese may address:\n\n* Temporary living arrangements\n* Visitation\n* Child support\n* Safety measures\n\n# 3. Discovery and information gathering\n\nBoth sides exchange documents. A **guardian ad litem (GAL)** may be appointed.\n\n# 4. Mediation (may not be safe)\n\nMediation can be unsafe in DV cases. Courts may:\n\n* Excuse mediation\n* Offer separate rooms (“shuttle mediation”)\n* Allow remote participation\n\n# 5. Settlement or trial\n\nIf no agreement is reached, the court holds a trial and makes final orders.\n\n\n\n# Safety Planning Around Custody and Visitation\n\n# For court\n\n* Ask for a safe waiting area\n* Bring support if allowed\n* Arrive/leave separately\n* Carry copies of court orders\n\n# For exchanges\n\n* Use public, well-lit areas\n* Request third-party exchanges\n* Keep communication brief\n* Use court-recommended apps\n\n# For children\n\n* Teach age-appropriate safety steps\n* Share custody orders with schools\n* Create a simple emergency plan\n\n\n\n# Working With Lawyers and Advocates in Alabama\n\n# Lawyers\n\nOptions include:\n\n* Private attorneys\n* Legal aid\n* Clinics\n\n# Advocates\n\nThey can help with:\n\n* Safety planning\n* Court preparation\n* Emotional support\n* Resource connections\n\nFind local advocates through:\n\n* Alabama Coalition Against Domestic Violence (ACADV)\n* Local hotlines\n\n\n\n# Common Concerns Survivors Have About Custody in Alabama\n\n# “Will I lose my children if I leave?”\n\nLeaving does **not** mean losing custody. Courts must consider domestic violence.\n\n# “What if the abusive parent threatens to take the children?”\n\nDocument threats (if safe), and consider legal options like PFAs or emergency custody.\n\n# “My child is afraid to visit. Will the court listen?”\n\nCourts consider the child’s fears, maturity, and input from GALs or counselors.\n\n# “The abuse was mostly against me. Does it matter?”\n\nYes. Abuse against a parent affects the child and is considered in custody decisions.\n\n\n\n# Taking Care of Yourself While Navigating Custody\n\nConsider:\n\n* Counseling\n* Support groups\n* Child therapy\n* Support networks\n\nYou deserve safety and support.\n\n\n\n# Next Steps\n\nConsider:\n\n1. Talking with a DV-informed lawyer\n2. Contacting a local DV program\n3. Learning about Alabama’s custody and PFA laws\n4. Safely documenting incidents\n\nYou are not alone.\n\n\n\n# Suggested Internal Links\n\n* **Alabama DV legal guide** → `/alabama/domestic-violence-law-guide`\n* **Alabama PFA orders** → `/alabama/protection-from-abuse-orders`\n* **Safety planning for parents** → `/alabama/dv-safety-plan-parents`\n* **Find Alabama DV lawyers** → `/alabama/domestic-violence-lawyers`\n* **Custody FAQ** → `/alabama/child-custody-faq`\n\n\n\n# Frequently Asked Questions\n\n# How does domestic violence affect child custody decisions in Alabama?\n\nCourts apply a rebuttable presumption against granting custody to a parent who committed domestic violence. Judges focus on safety, history of violence, and the child’s needs.\n\n# Can I get temporary custody through a PFA?\n\nYes. PFAs can include temporary custody, supervised visitation, and safe exchange rules.\n\n# Will the court believe me without police reports?\n\nYes. Many forms of evidence are accepted, including testimony, messages, medical records, and witnesses.\n\n# Can an abusive parent get joint custody?\n\nIt is difficult but possible if they present strong evidence to overcome the presumption. Courts prioritize safety.\n\n# Can visitation be supervised?\n\nYes. Courts can order supervised or restricted visitation with safety conditions.\n\n# Do I have to mediate?\n\nNot always. Mediation may be excused or modified in DV cases.\n\n# At what age can a child choose?\n\nThere is no set age. Judges consider the child’s maturity and whether fear or pressure is involved.\n\n# Where can I get help if I cannot afford a lawyer?\n\nLegal aid, clinics, DV shelters, and advocacy organizations can assist.",

    "selftext": "**“Favoritism is the oldest trick in the book — not because it works, but because people are too afraid to stand without it. Every day, the world repeats the same tired routine: those within the circle are praised, those outside are ignored, and those who question the pattern are treated like noise. It isn’t merit that determines worth — it’s alliances, convenience, and shallow approval.**\n\nPeople seek validation like oxygen. They act sweet, polite, and careful — only toward those they think matter. To everyone else, silence and avoidance become their language. The truth is simple: society doesn’t reward goodness; it rewards belonging. And belonging isn't earned — it’s traded.\n\nFavoritism is not kindness. It is strategy disguised as morality.\n\nThe strange part is how normal it feels. How naturally the hierarchy forms. How easily people choose sides without understanding why. One becomes powerful. Others orbit. And the rest stay silent — watching, doubting, pretending they don’t see how fake everything is.\n\nWhat looks like confidence is usually insecurity wearing loud clothing.\n\nPeople learn quickly:  \nBe close to the right crowd.  \nSay the right lines.  \nSmile in the right direction.  \nAnd silent cruelty becomes an acceptable language.\n\nIt always starts the same way — with performance. The sweet gestures. The filtered behavior. The artificial humility. Not because they care — but because admiration is the new currency.\n\nFor many, morality isn’t a belief — it’s a tool.\n\nRules, values, ethics… they appear only when useful, only when they help someone get attention or impression. Especially when the goal is to be noticed, admired, or adored. Actions become rehearsed. Words become scripted. Personalities become characters in a show no one admits they’re acting in.\n\nCruelty enters quietly. First through jokes. Then gossip. Then judgment disguised as opinion. Soon, reputation becomes a weapon, and silence becomes consent.\n\nCharacter assassination and moral performance are two sides of the same coin — both used to control, filter, and position oneself above someone else.\n\nAnd society claps.\n\nNot because it supports truth — but because it fears isolation.\n\nThose who lose favor are treated like ghosts. Their worth becomes negotiable. Their existence becomes optional. Not because they changed — but because the crowd did.\n\nFavoritism creates hierarchy.  \nHierarchy creates fear.  \nFear creates performance.  \nAnd performance replaces humanity.\n\nEventually, the system becomes so normal that no one remembers how real integrity looks.\n\nIn this structure, people aren’t valued — roles are. Personalities aren’t understood — they're sorted. Intentions aren’t questioned — they’re assumed.\n\nPeople chase admiration the way thirsty animals chase water — blindly, desperately, and sometimes stupidly. And the sad part is: even when they get it, they never feel complete. Because validation earned through performance never satisfies — it only demands more performance.\n\nThe world becomes a circus.  \nPeople become actors.  \nMorality becomes costume.  \nAnd sincerity becomes rare.\n\nThose who don’t fit the script are labeled strange.  \nThose who refuse to fake are labeled difficult.  \nThose who speak truth are labeled threats.\n\nFavoritism doesn’t build community — it builds kingdoms.  \nNot of strength — but of insecurity, ego, and fear.\n\nAnd in the end, every kingdom built on performance eventually collapses — not from attack, but from internal emptiness.”\\*\\*",

    "title": "9 more Bingo Reviews! Highlights: The Rook, Obsidian Path, Scythe",
    "selftext": "Hey all! I'm trying two cards this year, 1 all HM and 1 all EM – this is my next batch of EM reviews!\n\n**(1) Knights/Paladins (EM) – *Death Masks*, by Jim Butcher (Dresden #5) – 3.5/5**\n\nThis is book 5 of the Dresden files, so if you’re new to the series you won’t be starting here. I think this book had ups and downs – I really liked the plotline with the Fallen and Nicodemus, which feels like something that’ll be important going forward. On the other hand, the whole thing with Ortega felt like a contrived, unnecessary add-in which distracted from the main event. I get that Dresden’s life isn’t story-worthy unless he has 6 different life-or-death problems at a time, but I would’ve been happy if this whole B-plot were cut.\n\n**(7) A Book in Parts (EM) – *There is No Antimemetics Division*, by QNTM – 4/5**\n\nThis is a series of stories (at first loosely connected but increasingly unified in plot) about the Antimemetics Division, a quasi-governmental agency dedicated to fighting anti-memetic threats: thoughts that harm the thinker, hazards which can’t be remembered, etc. Most of these stories follow the head of the division, Marion Wheeler.\n\nThese started strong. The first handful are great horror stories, my favorite being *Introductory Antimemetics*. The later stories, however, felt increasingly hard to follow. Not shocking when the subject matter is unthinkable thoughts. That said, I read the original online version and my understanding is that the print-published version was rewritten and polished. The online version, though, is also full of links to the SCP archive (basically fictional case files on the paranormal), many of which are fun and flavorful and offer a whole new rabbit hole to get lost in.\n\nAlso works for: Epistolary (EM)\n\n**(8) Gods/Pantheons (EM) – *An End to Sorrow*, by Michael R. Fletcher  – 4.5/5**\n\nThis is the finale to the Obsidian Path trilogy, a character-focused story about the former Demon Emperor who lost much of his memory/self/soul when dethroned. He spends the series searching for and regaining literal pieces of it one by one, while struggling to avoid turning into the awful person he used to be. Be warned – this series is very dark.\n\nThis book (the conclusion specifically) hit me in the same way as *No Country for Old Men*. I threw it down, I rated it 2/5 stars, and wondered where the hell was the actual ending to the story. But that frustration grew into an appreciation for what (I assume) the author was doing and why. The plot is in some sense unfinished, and almost begs for more books set in this world. But the character arc concludes beautifully, and the act of cutting the story short with the climax of the protagonist’s psychological journey feels like a message to the reader: *this was never about all the things happening in the world, the real story was always about who Khraen would become.*\n\nAlso works for: Last in a Series (EM), Small Press or Self-Published (EM) \n\n**(12) Epistolary (EM) – *The Rook*, by Daniel O’Malley (Chequy #1) – 4.5/5**\n\nThe protagonist finds herself standing with dead bodies all around and no memory of who she is, then has to bluff her way through her day job, which turns out to be a management position at a branch of british intelligence dedicated to paranormal threats. This book was really excellent, despite the fact that I don’t usually go in for spy thrillers. It reminded me of the video game *Control*, the way the author peppers the story with paranormal worldbuilding to hint at untold mysteries behind the scenes. As I read, I was actually getting frustrated with the fact that the author had created a fascinating world which could never be explored in a standalone novel – only to learn, after finishing the book, that this was actually book 1 of a series. Strong recommend. \n\n**(15) Small Press or Self-Published (EM) – *Murder on the Lamplight Express*, by Morgan Stang (Lamplight #2) – 4/5**\n\nThis is the sequel to *Murder at Spindle Manor*, and follows a similar outline. We have a spooky setting lit by gaslamps, horrors lurking just beyond the light, a murder mystery with a handful of colorful suspects and miscellaneous hidden motives for red herrings, and a classic Holmes-and-Watson pair of detectives. It’s good fun, it’s a page turner, the setting interacts meaningfully with the mystery rather than just adding window dressing, and the mystery is well-crafted enough that you could (but probably won’t) piece it all together before the reveal.\n\n**(16) Biopunk (EM) – *We Are Legion (We Are Bob)*, by Dennis E.  Taylor (Bobiverse #1) – 3/5**\n\nThe premise of this book is that the protagonist Bob dies, gets cryo-frozen, and is woken up in the far future as disembodied cyberintelligence. I think this one starts strong, but the author chooses to take the plot in relatively uninteresting directions. It’s not that the book’s base concept is forgotten about (it definitely isn’t), but the focus of the book shifts to standard sci-fi fare like space battles and interstellar exploration. The author doesn’t explore the psychological reality of Bob’s experience in the way I would’ve wanted him to. It’s a fine, entertaining novel, but it had the potential to be something a lot more interesting and unique. \n\nAlso works for: Small Press or Self-Published (EM)\n\n**(18) LGBTQIA Protagonist (EM) – *Gideon the Ninth*, by Tamsyn Muir (Locked Tomb #1) – 3.5/5**\n\nGideon, an orphan child raised by the Ninth House (AKA, ninth planet in an interstellar empire of necromancers), wants to flee the Ninth and its heir Harrow, Gideon’s rival and childhood enemy. Things do not go according to plan.\n\nI enjoyed this, but struggled with parts of it. The author hooks you with *space empire fueled by necromancy*, but this is barely developed and quickly sidelined in favor of something like a murder mystery. The author builds this gothic atmosphere and setting, which is genuinely cool, but then sets the reader to wander that setting for hundreds of pages without enough plot to animate the story (see what I did there?). I didn’t love the mystery itself, since the reader isn’t given enough information to put the pieces together ahead of the actual reveal. Gideon is an entertaining protagonist and sometimes genuinely funny, but she also talks like a modern high school student, which sometimes killed the immersion. Gideon and Harrow’s weird, fraught relationship ultimately carries the book, along with a great ending. I might continue onto book 2 on the strength of that alone. \n\nAlso works for: Knights and Paladins (HM), Book in Parts (HM)\n\n**(19) Five Short Stories (EM):**\n\n*Why Don’t We Just Kill the Kid in the Omelas Hole*, by Isabel J. Kim – 4.5/5\nThis story is a flash flood of dark hilarity and thought-provoking, incisive wittiness. You can agree or disagree with the author’s take on *The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas*, but either way it’s great fun and very well-done.\n\n*Five Views of the Planet Tartarus*, by Rachael K. Jones – 3/5\nNeat, well-done, and as good a story as can be expected from 3 paragraphs … but you can only do so much with 3 paragraphs.\n\n*Three Faces of a Beheading*, by Arkady Martine – 3/5\nA mishmash of ideas, but the story ends before the author can make effective use of them.\n\n*Stitched to Skin Like Family Is*, by Nghi Vo – 4.5/5\nThis story really worked for me; tightly written with a good concept and protagonist. Magical realism and a bit of horror as a young Chinese woman searches America for her brother during the Great Depression. \n\n*Marginalia*, by Mary Robinette – 2.5/5\nMeh? Classic fantasy fare in spite of the giant snails, never hooked me and fairly forgettable.\n\n**(21) Recycle a Bingo Square (EM)(2022: No Ifs, Ands, or Buts)  – *Scythe*, by Neil Shusterman (Arc of a Scythe #1) – 4/5**\n\n*Scythe* is set a few hundred years in the future, after the development of ASI has resulted in a utopia, complete with medical technology that can reverse aging and heal nearly any injury. Life is perfect, however meaningless peoples’ day to day has become, and mankind is no longer mortal. The only exception is the Scythes, people who are above the law and whose job is to humanely kill those they see fit, both as a curb to population growth and to remind people that their immortality is not guaranteed.\n\nLike *Bob*, this had the potential to be more than it was. Unlike *Bob*, this one was quite good regardless. The first half, which focused on the philosophical and psychological difficulties and questions inherent in a Scythe’s work, was an easy 5/5. How should a person face death, or deliver it? What does it mean to be an ethical executioner? What’s a healthy psychological reaction to that sort of work? Somehow, despite a YA feel, the book put these important questions front and center in a mature, thoughtful way that was well-integrated into the plot. Unfortunately, the second half of the book drops to a 3/5 after the author places the protagonists in conflict with a straightforward, despicable evil. All those interesting shades of philosophical grey are sidelined in favor of a good versus evil narrative. It remains an engaging story, but it does lose something. Regardless, strong recommend.\n\nAlso works for: Author of Color (EM)",

    "selftext": "\nBeen thinking about this and what if the Kirk shooting was about something else entirely? \n\n\nOther than just the fact he was influential over a certain segment of the right wing movement in the US or because TPUSA would lose sum funding?\n\nBecause Tucker's still going for example .  I'd make the case that in a way, he's a lot more influential in a sense. Certainly internationally speaking, over here in the UK, up until Kirk was shot almost no one here knew who he was. Lots of people know about Carlson here though. \n\n Also..Owens says she's been threatened... but she's still making vids. Still breathing so far. More on Owens in a bit but... here's the thing...\n\nWhat if we've all been looking in the wrong direction? Kirk was this committed Christian right? Unless that was really all just bull....but...\n\nThing is, Trump's been acting real weird lately about the files. Patel looked liked he'd seen a ghost after viewing some of evidence that has, as yet to see the light of day.\n\nKirk could have just been on the grift but what if he found out something real dank about Trump and his predilections? \n\nWhat if he was about to go public with it? I'm not a Kirk fan. But some things for some people are just beyond the pale. Kid fiddling is one of them. Some people can look the other way over this kind of thing but some people can't. Maybe their morality or in Kirk's case actual belief compels them to come clean about whatever they'd seen, or discovered, or learned. \n\nKirk was quite high up within the right wing movement but also, if you think about all of Kirk's connections, actually there's quite a few ways he could have learned something. Maybe he actually had some hard evidence. Maybe he was about to share it.\n\nMaybe that's the real reason he took a bullet. When you're the head of state, you have three letter agencies at your literal behest. I'd say it sure is a hell of a lot easier to assassinate from within, and then cover it up too.\n\nI dunno about the death threat Owen's received. Could be a complete nothing burger. But also, she was digging into Macron, and child abuse and that's where everything starts to look a bit different, when you really think about it.\n\nA death threat from France? Passed on by someone in the French intelligence service? But why? Either she's total schizo or....what if it's connected to filthy shit the Macron's either covered up, want covered up or were somehow involved in? Cos what I do know is she was poking around in some really dusty cupboards when she was doing the deep dive in to \"Bridget\".\n\nMaybe Carlson and Owens aren't just grifters. Maybe they do want the truth. And maybe, just maybe neither of them know the full facts yet .\n\nMaybe they don't know their own President set up the hit on Charlie to shut him up before he coughed up some REAL dark shit. The kind of shit the public has a right to know.\n\nMaybe Owens really should be concerned. If her claims about being threatened aren't just a grift and she can back them up she's said herself the US gov has receipt of whatever evidence she has.\n\nOkay, this could amount to the cache of a 4chan schizo or....it could show that actually, yeah she was threatened. If so the US will obviously want to take action, to protect one of its own citizens right?\n\nUnless...it wants that citizen to stop digging. Unless by doing so alllll the filthy disgusting stuff that Trump, Macron and whoever else has been up to is gonna all come tumbling out. When you think about it like this, it's pretty obvious who had the most skin in the game when it comes to Kirk.\n\nAnyway, guess we'll find out if Owens is a kook or not soon anyway since now she has forwarded the \"evidence of the threat\" to the US Government  by their response. \n\nWhat if the whole paedo jig was about to be up and Kirk was about to blow the whistle on Trump? What if he wasn't actually full of shit and his faith meant that he couldn't keep silent about what he had learned?\n\n",

    "selftext": "**Judgment Day '00**\n\nDate: May 21st\n\nLocation: Freedom Hall, Louisville, Kentucky\n\n**WWF Intercontinental Championship**\n\n**Eddie Guerrero w/Chyna** vs. Rikishi\n\n**WWF World Tag Team Championship**\n\nEdge &amp; Christian vs. **Too Cool (Scotty 2 Hotty &amp; Grand Master Sexy)**\n\n**Street Fight Match**\n\n**Kane** vs. X-Pac\n\n(X-Pac justifies abandoning Kane, saying he was tired of always being in his shadow and that Kane got all the attention he says he deserves. Kane confronts him and tells him he will never forgive him for betraying him and challenges him to a street fight at Judgment Day. X-Pac tries to make him feel inferior and tells him that after he kicks his ass, he will leave, covering his face to cry with his mommy in hell. Kane, enraged, attacks him brutally and responds that he will wish he had never been born. Kane absolutely slaughters X-Pac, who tries to defend himself, but Kane dominates and destroys him all over the ring, even throwing him from the top of the set onto a table where the electronic equipment was located in a spectacular spot to take the victory.)\n\n**WWF European Championship - Submission Match**\n\n**Chris Benoit** vs. Chris Jericho **(By Technical Knock-Out)**\n\n(Jericho, without a girlfriend and title, falls into despair and, to prove that he is not a loser, challenges Chris Benoit once again for the European Championship, telling him that there can only be one Chris who deserves that championship and that Chris is himself. Benoit tells him that if he were as good as he says he is, he would already be world champion and that he had better shut up and show him that he can beat him by submission, as he did at Backlash. Y2J accepts and swears that he will dominate him in the ring. It is the same sublime match we had in real life, with the same ending. Jericho refuses to give up again after being trapped in a Crossface and loses consciousness, so the referee declares Benoit the winner by technical knockout.)\n\nKurt Angle vs. Tazz **(Double Disqualification)**\n\n(Angle and Tazz, fed up with each other, challenge each other to a fight to end this dispute once and for all. Two wrestling machines face off in a chaotic and frenetic match, which goes off the rails when both throw the rules out the window and start hitting each other with objects, resulting in a double disqualification and no winner. They continue to beat each other up all over the arena until they throw themselves onto a couple of tables from a great height among the audience, leaving both of them out of commission and needing medical attention. Later in Backstage segments, we see Kurt waking up and getting off the stretcher to go and hit Tazz. He finds him and attacks him, but Tazz defends himself and the two continue to attack each other until they reach the parking lot, where Tazz applies a Suplex to Angle on the roof of a car. There, the two are finally separated and assisted by medical personnel.)\n\n**WWF Championship - Last Man Standing Match - Shawn Michaels as Special Guest Referee**\n\nThe Rock vs. **Triple H w/Stephanie &amp; Shane McMahon**\n\n(Once again, Triple H is given another chance, this time thanks to the help of the absent and corrupt Commissioner Michaels, who in turn proposes himself as the guest referee for the match and agrees that it will be a Last Man Standing Match. Rocky, unable to do anything to avoid facing The Game again, accepts, but on one condition: if Triple H loses, he will not be able to challenge him for the title again, and Shawn must also resign from his position as commissioner. Hunter and Shawn accept with laughter because they know there is no way The Rock will walk away with the belt. Another fierce and brutal match from start to finish, The Rock tries to keep Trips and Michaels himself at bay, who counts very slowly when Hunter is on the ground but counts very quickly when The Rock is on the ground. During the match, Shane and Stephanie interfere in favor of Triple H, but The Rock repels them with the help of Mick Foley, who fights Shane in the crowd and knocks him out, while Stephanie gets a Rock Bottom on a table. Triple H, tired of games, mercilessly attacks The Rock and throws him out of the ring. Michaels follows them to the ramp, and Hunter prepares a Pedigree, but Rocky defends himself and tries to hit him with a Rock Bottom, but HBK hits him with Sweet Chin' Music and The Rock falls. Triple H lifts him up and hits him with a Pedigree against the metal ramp so that Michael can start the count as quickly as possible. Before The Rock can get up, Shawn reaches 10 and declares Triple H the winner and new WWF champion. Both celebrate with Vince, who comes out to party with all his bootlickers and taunt the fans, but then the lights go out and chilling videos appear on the Titantron with a phrase that says “Judgment Day is Now.” A man on a motorcycle appears at the entrance, with heavy rock entrance music playing. It's The Undertaker! Now with a very different look, the fans erupt and Taker attacks everyone in the ring, hitting them all with Tombstone Piledrivers. He holds up the WWF title and rides away on his motorcycle, raising his arm in victory for his return, thus ending the event.)\n\n***Notes:***\n\n(Due to his interference in the match between The Rock and Triple H, Shawn Michaels is dismissed by Linda McMahon as commissioner and Mick Foley is appointed as the new WWF commissioner.)\n\n**King of the Ring '00**\n\nDate: June 25th\n\nLocation: Fleet Center, Boston, Massachusetts\n\n**KOTR 1st Round (On Raw is War and Smackdown!)**\n\n**The Big Show** vs. Al Snow\n\n**Steve Blackman** vs. Bull Buchanan\n\n**Tazz** vs. Prince Albert\n\nCrash Holly vs. **Hardcore Holly**\n\n**Edge** vs. Matt Hardy\n\n**Chris Jericho** vs. Billy Gunn\n\n**Chyna** vs. The Godfather\n\nD’Lo Brown vs. **Scotty 2 Hotty**\n\n**Kurt Angle** vs. Perry Saturn\n\n(After the match, Perry is attacked by Crash, who pins him and regains the Hardcore Championship.)\n\n**The Big Boss Man** vs. Bubba Ray Dudley\n\n**Rikishi** vs. Road Dogg\n\nVal Venis vs. **Dean Malenko**\n\nChristian vs. **Jeff Hardy**\n\n**Eddie Guerrero** vs. Grand Master Sexy\n\n**Kane** vs. D-Von Dudley\n\n**Chris Benoit** vs. Taka Michinoku\n\n**KOTR 2nd Round (On Raw is War and Smackdown!)**\n\n**The Big Show** vs. Steve Blackman\n\n**Tazz** vs. Hardcore Holly\n\nEdge vs. **Chris Jericho**\n\n**Chyna** vs. Scotty 2 Hotty\n\n**Kurt Angle** vs. The Big Boss Man\n\n**Rikishi** vs. Dean Malenko\n\nJeff Hardy vs. **Eddie Guerrero (By Disqualification)**\n\n(Eddie pulls his first trick here, pretending that Jeff hit him with the Intercontinental title, throwing the championship into his hands and throwing himself to the ground, taking advantage of the fact that he hit the referee “by accident.” The referee looks at the situation, thinks that Jeff carried out the act, and rings the bell, sending Eddie on to the next round.)\n\nKane vs. **Chris Benoit**\n\n(During the match, Kane is brutally attacked by X-Pac with a chair and left badly injured. Chris defeats him after applying a Dragon Suplex. After the match, X-Pac hits Kane in the head with another chair, leaving him seriously injured and taking Kane off television.)\n\n**KOTR 3rd Round (On Raw is War and Smackdown!)**\n\nThe Big Show vs. **Tazz**\n\n**Chris Jericho** vs. Chyna\n\n**Kurt Angle** vs. Rikishi\n\nEddie Guerrero vs. **Chris Benoit**\n\n(The European Champion and the Intercontinental Champion face off in an intense and spectacular match on Smackdown. Eddie tries to cheat his way to victory, but Benoit stops him and forces him into a Crossface. Eddie manages to break free, but Benoit grabs him again and hits him with a devastating Dragon Suplex for the pinfall. Chris advances to the semifinals, while Eddie looks on in anger as he is defeated by his teammate.)\n\n**Main Show:**\n\n**KOTR 4th Round**\n\n**Tazz** vs. Chris Jericho\n\n**Kurt Angle** vs. Chris Benoit\n\n**Double Tables Match**\n\n**The Dudley Boyz (Bubba Ray &amp; D-Von)** vs. The New Age Outlaws (Road Dogg &amp; Billy Gunn)\n\n**WWF World Tag Team Championship - Fatal 4-Way Elimination Tag Team Match**\n\nToo Cool (Scotty 2 Hotty &amp; Grand Master Sexy) vs. **Edge &amp; Christian** vs. The Hardy Boyz (Jeff &amp; Matt) vs. T &amp; A (Test &amp; Albert)\n\n**WWF Hardcore Championship - Triple Threat Hardcore Match**\n\n**Al Snow** vs. Crash Holly vs. Perry Saturn\n\n**KOTR Final Round**\n\nTazz vs. **Kurt Angle**\n\n(Once again, the two cross paths, this time in the grand finale of the King of the Ring tournament. The winner will get a title shot. Now everything is at stake, and they can't lose their cool. Angle hates Tazz for humiliating him and taking away his Intercontinental title, and Tazz hates Kurt for costing him the title and insulting him about his height. An instant classic of 20 minutes of technical and dramatic wrestling, with each dominating the other, both for the grand prize and to overcome the other. At the climax, Tazz tries to put Kurt to sleep with a Tazzmission, but Angle, about to fall, lunges forward, sending Tazz in front of him. He then grabs him and applies a suplex, picks him up again and applies another suplex, picks him up once more and sends him into the corner, hits him, lifts him up and applies a third and brutal aerial suplex. Both hit the canvas and with what little strength Kurt has left, he puts his arm over Tazz and gets the three count. The Olympic medalist wins King of the Ring and is crowned King, complete with a throne. Kurt gives a speech that starts out inspiring, talking about how he won those two gold medals at the Olympics and is now triumphing in the WWF, but then he says he did it all for himself, not for his country, not for anyone else, only for himself, and he will win the WWF championship at Summer Slam for himself.)\n\n**WWF Championship - Triple Threat Match**\n\nTriple H w/Stephanie McMahon vs. **The Rock** vs. The Undertaker\n\n(The Rock demands a title rematch for his unfair victory, which is initially denied, and instead Triple H will face The Undertaker for the title at King of the Ring, but WWF CEO Linda McMahon once again advocates for The Rock and adds him to the match. Vince, fed up with his wife meddling in his affairs, forces his son to take care of his own mother. Shane doesn't want to do it and begins to wonder whether to obey his father. In the match, we have an entertaining and chaotic Triple Threat, where the McMahons obviously interfere to help Triple H win, but Taker and Rocky team up to take them down. However, Vince goes crazy and attacks them with a chair and forces Shane to do the same, holding The Rock so he can hit him in the head with the chair. Shane refuses, but his father forces him to, and in a surprising move, he hits his father in the head instead and rebels against him, turning face and beating him up. Triple H attacks Shane with a sledgehammer and then takes care of Taker, throwing him out of the ring, and goes for the Pedigree on Rocky once again, But Taker returns, Shawn appears and helps Triple H win, taking out the Dead Man with Sweet Chin' Music. When he goes to do the same to The Rock, Rocky dodges him and Michaels' kick goes straight to Triple H's face, knocking him out in the process. Michaels can't believe what he did, and The Rock takes advantage of the situation to hit Shawn with a Rock Bottom and Triple H with a People's Elbow to win the WWF World Championship for the fourth time.)\n\n***Notes:***\n\n(Shawn Michaels is fired by Vince on national television for causing Hunter's defeat, this being his last appearance for the time being.)\n\n(Vince is taken off television due to a “shock” caused by his son Shane on King of the Ring, and from the hospital Vince warns Shane that he will regret betraying him.)\n\n(Triple H withdraws from his alliance with the Corporation, stating that all the support he needs is from Steph.)\n\n(Big Show goes to OVW.)\n\n**Fully Loaded '00**\n\nDate: July 23rd\n\nLocation: Reunion Arena, Dallas, Texas.\n\n**WWF Intercontinental Championship - Steel Cage Match**\n\n**Eddie Guerrero w/Chyna** vs. Rikishi\n\nA fun opener where Rikishi launches himself from the top of the cage to hit Eddie, but Guerrero resists and at the end of the match, it is Eddie who performs a Frog Splash from the top of the ladder onto Rikishi to retain the title.\n\n**WWF World Tag Team Championship - Tables Elimination Match**\n\n**Edge &amp; Christian** vs. The Dudley Boyz (Bubba Ray &amp; D-Von)\n\n(Edge and Christian annoy the Dudleys, mimicking their moves and gestures, dressing like them, and using tables, while the Dudley Boyz imitate Edge and Christian and dress like them, mocking their gestures and Canadian accent. Edge and Christian win after performing a 3-D on D-Von on some tables. After the match, the Hardy Boyz appear to attack both teams, ending in a brawl between the three teams.)\n\n**WWF European Championship - Triple Threat Match**\n\n**Chris Benoit** vs. Perry Saturn vs. Dean Malenko\n\n(After losing the Hardcore title, Perry becomes desperate and demands a shot at Benoit's European title. Benoit refuses, and Malenko initially acts as a mediator, but he also becomes interested in the title, and the two betray Benoit to go after the championship. An intense and frenetic triple threat match combining the styles of all three, Dean and Perry initially team up against Chris, but they attack each other knowing that only one can win. Benoit recovers and goes after them, and after Perry knocks Malenko out by hitting him with the steel stairs, Chris submits him with the Crossface to retain the title.)\n\n**Inferno Match**\n\n**Kane** vs. X-Pac\n\n(Kane returns after a month's absence and attacks X-Pac during an Intercontinental title match. He challenges him to another fight, this time swearing that he will send him to hell, where the flames will consume him and, as he promised, he will wish he had never been born. Another massacre by Kane on X-Pac, this time in a burning environment. X-Pac suffers the consequences of his actions and is set on fire. Not only that, but after being extinguished by an extinguisher by the officials, Kane attacks him, takes him behind the scenery, sets part of it on fire, hangs X-Pac, and throws him into the flames of hell, where he is consumed and disappears in the fire, thus ending the feud.)\n\n***Notes:***\n\n(Yes, in kayfabe Kane murdered a wrestler in front of thousands of people and continues to work in the WWF as if nothing happened, lol.)\n\nThe Undertaker vs. **Kurt Angle**\n\n(After winning King of the Ring, Kurt feels on top of the world, but one man will bring him back down to earth and teach him a lesson. The Undertaker confronts him and tells him that if he thinks he has what it takes to go for the WWF Championship, he will have to get past him first. If he can't beat him at Fully Loaded, he has no reason to go for the WWF Championship. Kurt is not intimidated and accepts the Undertaker's challenge. In a fierce and intense battle, Kurt defeats Undertaker in epic fashion with a clean victory after performing a moonsault from the third rope following a 25-minute match.)\n\n**WWF Championship - Three Stages of Hell Match**\n\n* **Street Fight Match (0-1)**\n* **Steel Cage Match (1-1)**\n* **Ladder Match (2-1)**\n\n**The Rock** vs. Triple H\n\n(The final chapter in the rivalry between The Rock and Triple H. The Game demands one more fight for the WWF title, using his title rematch to get it. Rocky tells him that now that he no longer has his daddy Vince helping him, he takes refuge in Steph. The Rock tells him that he is nothing more than Vince's bitch, the WWF's bitch, and even Stephanie's bitch, insinuating that Steph dominates and mistreats him. Trips, fed up, responds that he will no longer fight for anyone but himself, that he will seek the WWF championship again for himself and destroy him in a Triple Threat match for himself. Before the match, Triple H tells Stephanie that he doesn't want her to intervene on his behalf. He wants to finish off The Rock on his own, without anyone's help, no matter what happens. The first level is a street fight that Triple H wins by using weapons to his advantage, the second is a steel cage match, which Rocky wins after hitting Triple H with a Rock Bottom from one of the corners for the pin. Once the cage is lifted, the third level is revealed, with the WWF title appearing at the top, revealing that it is a ladder match, the same stipulation in which both fought for the Intercontinental title at SummerSlam '98. Both fight to reach the top of the ladder and grab the title. Each climbs a ladder and struggles at the top. Triple H almost throws Rocky off and tries to grab the title, but Rocky hits him with it and then slams his face against the edge of the ladder to finish with a Super Rock Bottom from the top of the ladder onto a table that was previously placed there. The Rock gets up and, with all his remaining strength, climbs the ladder, takes down the belt, and successfully retains the championship, ending his rivalry with The Game. The Rock celebrates on the ramp, raising his title high, and is confronted by Kurt Angle. Without saying anything or attacking him, the two stare each other down, and the event ends.)\n\n**Summer Slam '00**\n\nDate: August 27th\n\nLocation: RBC Center, Raleigh, North Carolina\n\n**No Disqualification Match**\n\nKane vs. **Tazz**\n\n(There isn't much history here, just two killing machines who once bumped into each other, disrespected each other, and fought each other, now facing each other in a brutal no-disqualification match that opens the event. Tazz defeats the red monster after slamming his head into a chair with a Tazzsuplex.)\n\n**WWF Intercontinental Championship - Tag Team Mixed Match**\n\n**Eddie Guerrero &amp; Chyna** vs. Val Venis &amp; Trish Stratus\n\n(Just like in real life, Latino Heat defends his title against Val Venis, but with his companions also competing in a mixed tag team match where whoever gets the pinfall walks away with the Intercontinental Championship around their waist. Chyna pins Trish, becoming the Intercontinental Champion for the second time and accidentally dethroning Eddie. Latino Heat celebrates with her, but behind his mischievous smile lies a feeling of anger and frustration.)\n\n**WWF European Championship - Two Out of Three Falls Match (2-1)**\n\n**Chris Benoit** vs. Chris Jericho\n\n(Y2J returns and demands another match against Benoit, arguing that he lost the previous match but did NOT give up, so he is still owed a title match. Benoit accepts, but sets two conditions: one is that it will be a best-of-three falls match, and the second is that if Jericho fails to defeat him, he will never be able to challenge him for the European Championship again. Y2J agrees to these terms. It's the same match they had in real life, but with the European Championship on the line. Benoit wins the first fall with a Dragon Suplex, then Jericho gets the second fall with a Codebreaker, but in the third fall, Benoit doesn't use the ropes. Instead, he catches Jericho with a Crossface. Jericho reaches the ropes, but Benoit releases him, pulls him back to the center of the ring, and chokes him again with a Crossface. Jericho can't take it anymore and succumbs to the pain, surrendering, and Benoit gets the third fall, winning and retaining the European title, much to the dismay and frustration of Y2J, who couldn't finish off Benoit, thus ending their feud... for now.)\n\n**WWF Hardcore Championship - Hardcore Match**\n\nShane McMahon vs. Crash Holly vs. **Al Snow** vs. Steve Blackman\n\n(Shane returns to the Hardcore division and wins and loses the championship several times during the summer, joining this chaotic fight between Crash Holly, Al Snow, and Steve Blackman, where he performs his spot of falling from the top of the set. In the end, it is Al Snow who ends up taking the victory, although he is then confronted by Crash, who takes the title from him and flees the arena. Steve hits him backstage and takes the title, but Shane has the last laugh and surprises Steve with a roll-up to regain the Hardcore Championship and leave the venue in his limousine.)\n\n**WWF World Tag Team Championship - Inaugural Tables, Ladders and Chairs Match**\n\nEdge &amp; Christian vs. **The Dudley Boyz (Bubba Ray &amp; D-Von)** vs. The Hardy Boyz (Jeff &amp; Matt) w/Lita\n\n(The same spectacular and entertaining TLC match we had in real life, except I decided that the Dudley Boyz should be the ones to walk away with the tag team gold that night, destroying Edge and Christian and the Hardys to take down the championships and recapture them.)\n\n**The Undertaker** vs. Triple H w/Stephanie McMahon\n\n(Both wrestlers begin a rivalry, with Triple H blaming Undertaker for losing the title at King of the Ring and meddling in his affairs, while Taker, as the WWF's enforcer, tells Hunter that his alliance and dominance over the world championship have damaged the World Wrestling Federation and he deserves to be punished. Trips mocks Taker, calling his new motorcycle outfit a midlife crisis and saying he doesn't give a damn what he says, he does what he wants, and what he wants right now is to beat him up at Summer Slam. An intense battle that is more about storytelling than technical action, but allows us to see a more aggressive Triple H and a tougher Taker, a violent fight without the need for extreme stipulations. At the climax of the fight, Triple H tries to use his mallet to hit Taker while Steph distracts the referee. He manages to do so and makes the count, but not only does Undertaker escape the count, he makes his comeback and prepares for the Tombstone Piledriver. but Stephanie prevents him from doing so. Undertaker, fed up with her, does what we all want to see and hits her with a Chokeslam. Triple H recovers and defends his wife, but Undertaker attacks him and hits him with a Last Ride, finally finishing him off with a Tombstone Piledriver and taking the victory after a 20-minute match.)\n\n**WWF Championship**\n\nThe Rock vs. Kurt Angle\n\n(Kurt Angle says he is ready for the big leagues and to win the WWF title less than a year after joining the company, but the current champion, The Rock, confronts him, responding that although he respects his discipline and the fact that he gave his country two Olympic gold medals, this is his town and he will defend it from pathetic, arrogant, and idiotic people like Kurt who think they are the center of the universe just because they are disciplined. Angle says he doesn't care what he thinks because he is sure he will beat him up and dominate him completely. An exciting and intense 25-minute main event with no interruptions, just two wrestlers competing against each other for the world title. Kurt would work on hurting Rocky's legs, while The Rock would constantly provoke Angle to act on impulse and thus surprise him with his moves. In the end, Kurt tried to submit Rocky with an Angle Lock, but The Rock refused to give up. Kurt, desperate, began to finish off The Rock with many suplexes and finished him off with an Angle Slam for the pinfall. but The Rock kicks out just before the count of three. Kurt, desperate, grabs Rocky's left leg and submits him with an Angle Lock. Rocky resists for a minute, and Angle throws himself onto the mat and transforms his move into a Gravepine Angle Lock. Rocky can't take the pain and taps out. Kurt Angle has achieved the unthinkable. He arrived as a rookie less than a year ago and now he has won the WWF championship, crowning himself at the top and generating mixed reactions among those who love and hate him. But in the end, that doesn't matter to Kurt, who celebrates as if he had won his third Olympic medal, thus closing SummerSlam.)\n\n**Winner: Kurt Angle**\n\nThat's all for today. I bet you thought I'd be gone for another five months, but no, my intention is to post one of these every three days or less. I'll be back in the next volume to cover the Olympic medalist's first world reign, the return of Stone Cold Steve Austin, and a much more satisfying revelation of who ran him over. And I'll give you a hint: no, it wasn't Rikishi with his stupid “I did it for The Rock” argument. See you next time, take care, and in case I don't see ya, good afternoon, good evening and good night.",

    "selftext": "Like atleast in solving the threat, I've no idea how to gain or maintian popularity.\n\nSo in the talk about the Guardians of the Globe from Invincible and how they're kinda jobby even thought they're like the best of the B-Team and the C-Team if you pulled them all together. My \"easy\" fix for this would be like fomenting teamwork and trying to get them to experiment with their abilities. How would I do this? Well if I was like I dunno subintendant in charge of em instead, I'd do like atleast weekly not mandatory but we will beg, paid reunions where they like bond or train together, mostly not spars but like test of abilites, see if anyone can react or handle being piggybacked by Red Rush, check if Rexplosions can boost like Samsons electric blasts or vice-versa, see who can or cannot to hang-on to the fliers, but more so let them fuck around with their abilities together as a group rather than try to max out their physical stats because most of team is just not proper bruisers.\n\nIf speaking of threats physical capabilities I feel like some decent armor could be provided on like GDAs budget, sure it won't be able to hang with the Top 10% or whatever but most of this team is glassy they need something, maybe it'd clash with someone like the Martians, Duplikate or Shrinking Ray, but even if not the best armor in the world I feel like a decent-ish portable energt shield is workable.\n\nThese are some of my tweaks that I think would turn the team less jobby. Inspired by alot of Star Wars talks where they discuss how to solve the Galactic Empires, Star Destroyer, Tie Fighter and Stormtrooper situation. The first one answer always seem to be Interdictor spam, which might work since it would deprive most Rebels of their hyperdrive hit &amp; run but I don't know the extra cost of an Interdicitor compared to a Star Destroyer, the fighters i'm not sure because the Tie Defender was an impossible solution it's just too expensive to mass produce maybe a dumbe down succesor could be but I'm not sure it'd get the results, the Stormtroopers I've no idea like overall they were better than your average Rebel trooper but whenever victory and the change of tides for the Rebellion was on the line they end up getting beaten, atleast out of the way enough for it to cost the Empire greatly.",

    "title": "The Current State of Mesoamerican Gameplay",
    "selftext": "I came to love this region in EU4 and it was the first (and only) one I've played in EU5 thus far. I wanted to give some of my general feedback as well as a bit of call to arms, to hopefully get some attention to various bugs associated with this region.\n\n\n\nSo, it should first be said that the only country in the region with any unique flavor is Tenochtitlan. Given the game is focused on Europe, I find that completely understandable and I think at some point in time this region will get more flavor, but it's worth noting that.\n\nOne thing that is nice is that there is a unique Mesoamerica tech tree in the Age of Traditions and the Age of Renaissance. This is one of the biggest plusses that I feel the devs gave to this region, even though it is maybe a bit small. It allows some abilities that exist in the normal institutions so that they can still do certain things without having all the gains from the normal institutions (in particular, it gives an alternative production method for weapons and allows you to invest in culture and gain more artists). As nice as this is, I really feel like the Age of Discovery should have a similar tree as it's basically impossible for you to get any old world institutions before the 1500s, but this would still allow you to gain some abilities that would make sense for that region. In particular, I think something for a little more sailor/ship production would make some sense. Right now, it's almost impossible to even transport one 300 size regiment with canoes. Other alternative production methods (that are less efficient, using copper or obsidian) would be useful for some basic staples, like tools, too. This kind of alternative tree would be useful in a lot of regions that won't easily get institutions but still would have gained some alternative ways of having those kind of advances in real life.\n\nNahua have two unique buildings that are blocked by feudalism, rendering them effectively useless, especially the manpower building, since by the time you can build it you will likely be able to build other manpower buildings soon enough.\n\nNahua is the only religion here with any flavor that stands out, as they have the doom mechanic that ticks up based on certain factors. Full doom will result in your nation imploding and your dynasty dying. You have to pass multiple separate reforms before you can fully reform the religion and it's a time intensive process that yields a very good reform and instant annexation of certain vassals. This is a good balance of effort and reward. However, this is currently bugged in that the doom mechanic does NOT go away when you reform, like it should. As such, it becomes hard to expand because more land causes doom to tick up higher and faster. There are mods out there to handle this but that shouldn't be required.\n\nMaya has the K'atun event that you can prepare for in different ways, resulting in strong modifiers if you get enough religious influence before the event triggers (every 19.7 years). This is fine though ultimately isn't something that requires much thought or strategy.\n\nNahua and Maya countries have the ability to host ceremonies but, to be honest, I felt very few were worth it for the cost, especially since they last such a short period of time. Tonal religions are incredibly basic with no special options or decisions.\n\nIt's worth noting that the unique Nahua flavor can be pretty impactful and a big differentiator between the Mayans/Tonalists. For example, you can actually create a professional army from day one, including sources of manpower. Mayans do not have this and are entirely at the mercy of their levies until they can get institutions from colonizers.\n\nNahua countries also can only (initially) take vassals and not provinces for themselves. This is an interesting way of playing and while you can still get land through integrations, it's obviously quite a bit slower. I actually like this a lot except 1.0.8 introduced the centralization/decentralization changes. The problem there is that the situation that allows you to reform your religion requires you to get 80 centralization but your religion forces you to rely heavily on vassals and now you get huge vassal maluses for being centralized. The game wants you to get a bunch of vassals but then requires such high centralization that you almost need to integrate before reforming, making the instant annexations from the situation ending much less useful. You could go a lot slower but this seriously degrades the play experience of the first 200 years into very low choice/action gameplay. I think it would be better if the situation would allow you to finish with either high centralization, high loyalty of your vassals, a certain amount of average control, a certain number of provinces owned, or a certain amount of crown power. There is more than one way to signify the nation gaining control.\n\nThe Great Pestilence as a situation actually is really effective at giving a truly brutal hit in the early/mid game that takes a lot to prepare for and repair from. That is, when it works correctly. Keep in mind, the situation gets a 1% chance to be triggered whenever an old world nation colonizes anywhere in the Americas. For it to end, at least one location in the Andes, Mesoamerica, and the Caribbean must be infected by the Great Pestilence for the situation to end -- that's it. Right now, there's two issues with this.\n\n1. The Great Pestilence quickly spreads to those three areas, instantly ending the situation. However, this means that the actions you can take from the situation are instantly repealed. One of them is to cut off contact with foreigners, which is one of the only ways you can realistically lessen the deaths from the GP.  So, the situation will end while the disease is still actively and heavily spreading in the lands, causing your protection from cutting off contact to end. This RNG can result in a different of 40-50% deaths. I don't think it makes sense. I think you should be able to cut off contact as long as the disease is spreading.\n2. For some reason, the disease algorithm spread is far from guaranteed in hitting all three of those areas. In two of my three runs, either Cuba or the Andes did not get any infection. I've seen other runs where this happened as well. As such, the situation and the nasty events continued for decades, even after the main outbreak of the Great Pestilence was finished. This has the double bad outcome of 1) punishing countries long after the actual pestilence has died out and 2) letting some countries off the hook completely in terms of deaths for no apparent reason. If this occurs, the only hope of ending it is to hope to get a minor outbreak of GP in those areas.\n\nI think the real solution here is that the situation should end when the main outbreak of the Great Pestilence ends and the algorithm of the disease spread should be modified to ensure every area gets hit. This always takes a few years, ensuring every nation will have to deal with it, and allows you the protection of cutting off contact with foreigners.\n\nA lot of people complain about the lack of tin and iron and I think in some ways it is overblown. It is an issue you have to deal with but there are alternative ways of mostly balancing your tool/stone/lumber/weapon resources. You have to be really picky in what buildings you allow to be built or which ones you keep, especially after annexing, and focus commercial buildings only on ones that don't require tools, lumber, or stone. Changing production methods and expanding via colonizing can substantially help the resource issue as well, so I think there \\*are\\* options for the player here. It's a good economic challenge at a time when you're probably not dealing with a lot of threats (post native expansion, pre-colonizers).\n\nThat said, I think additional alternative production methods, such as with copper and more with obsidian, would be useful, especially when making tools. They can be more inefficient than their tin/iron counterparts, but I think there's historical support for this and it would offer a little more flexibility for players in this region.\n\nExploration and colonization is fine for Mesoamerica. Getting maps of the Americas is pretty easy from spying on Society of Pops and colonization can get you access to useful land and resources while costing quite a bit of money. That tradeoff seems balanced to me, especially during the slow periods after you conquer most/all of Mesoamerica and are waiting on colonizers to arrive. Without this to do, it would be quite boring.\n\nLastly, when the colonizers come, it can be pretty easy to start learning institutions. You need to get a market center with the institutions (either by the colonizers colonizing it or you taking it (or making it) and getting it from colonizers via adjacency and trading). Then, you can use all your trade capacity to import from the market with the center that has institutions, resulting in upwards of 1% or more gained per month. So, while you are incredibly behind on tech, there is a path to getting going again quickly.\n\nHowever, with colonizers comes conquistadors, the last source of pain I want to talk about. Right now, Conquistadors can spawn in your land at any location, without any warning, with a professional army of 4k soldiers, and they function as a horde. That means when they siege a land, they own it. From there, they can immediately start recruiting new armies and navies. This can quickly spiral out of your control if you don't have an equivalently sized professional army (something the Nahua can manage with Jaguar and Eagle Warriors, but the Mayans and others cannot). The ability of levies to fight them was awful when I played last but that's been revised about seven times since then, so I'm not sure how well they stack up now. You have to both take back all the land and wipe the army to end the war, which is quite difficult.\n\nIn one of my games, I had three of these conquistador hordes spawn within a year, all from Castille. It was pretty brutal and, probably intentionally, there's no way any AI would ever be able to stop that. As a human, it was still extremely hard. But here's the worst part, especially since you likely have a lot of vassals as a Nahua nation (or any nation given the current meta): If the conquistador horde happens to own all locations of one of your vassals, those cores are gone forever. If you take them, they will be uncored with 50% separatism. If the vassal that had them was entirely occupied, their cores will no longer exist. This seems extremely punitive and probably unintentional, since your own cores and existing vassal cores still exist if you reconquer the land. This means that these conquistador hordes can effectively render multiple locations useless for decades, even if they only controlled them for a few months.\n\nBut that's not all! If the conquistador horde controls any provinces when you wipe their army, they instantly form a nation of all provinces they ever controlled (even if you currently control them) and you start with a truce with them. So, in that case, your rewards for being victorious is actually a resounding defeat. This is clearly a bug that simply needs to be fixed.\n\nI think these conquistador hordes need to be tuned down. For one, they shouldn't be able to spawn inside of your country without any kind of notice. There should be a naval invasion or a land invasion at your borders, not an instant spawn. That could at least give you a chance to raise levies and strengthen borders as preparation instead of this magic arrival. They shouldn't ever be able to erase cores, even if they fully occupy a vassal's lands. I also think their movement speed should be tuned down, because they're hard to chase down with armies that have to be bigger to compete (leading to them more easily sieging down land). Besides, who would move faster in these lands, some outsiders or natives? Also, some type of cooldown would make sense. Three wars in one year is a lot and that was from only one colonizer. What happens when multiple colonizers appear? It would have been better if Castille itself had declared on me because at least they'd have to occupy something for war score, I would have time to prepare, and they couldn't magically appear and summon armies out of nothing, nor would I have to peace them out three separate times.\n\nThat's as far as I got, to be honest. Dealing with the conquistadors and the levy changes at the time really soured me and I put a pause on things. At the time, I was learning tech and if I pushed through the conquistador hordes, there was a path to one day doing a sunset invasion, but the risk of even more bugs made not want to see it through.\n\nFeel free to discuss these points and if you agree with those I've made, an upvote on the bug report threads would be appreciated. Remember, it's not the thumbs up on the post, but the up arrow in the upper right corner of the post. If you disagree with some of these sentiments, I'd be curious to hear why. I'd like to be clear that I don't think this region should be easy by any means and I really don't think it is right now -- the lack of institutions and tech is truly punishing, not to mention the resource shortage and, oh yeah, the deaths of 30-50% of your population in even the best cases (and 80-90% in the worst). I just want it to feel a little more fair to the player that has overcome obstacles and created a strong nation. I'm also not necessarily advocating for some huge influx of flavor content right away, as I know it's not a prime region (though I do hope it comes someday).\n\nIf you're interested in a longer guide/playthrough of a Nahua country, one in which I discovered most of this stuff firsthand, I have one as Tenochtitlan at: [https://youtu.be/AUIfCvhPCCQ](https://youtu.be/AUIfCvhPCCQ)\n\nDoom not being removed after reforming society: [https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/aztec-reforming-society-doesnt-get-rid-of-doom-mechanic.1868111](https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/aztec-reforming-society-doesnt-get-rid-of-doom-mechanic.1868111)\n\nGreat Pestilence issues: [https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/great-pestilence-situation-can-last-for-decades-depending-on-where-colonization-starts.1873332/](https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/great-pestilence-situation-can-last-for-decades-depending-on-where-colonization-starts.1873332/)\n\nConquistador Horde issues: [https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/conquistadors-do-not-return-territory-when-defeated.1871351/#post-30906159](https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/conquistadors-do-not-return-territory-when-defeated.1871351/#post-30906159)\n\n[https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/when-conquistadors-take-over-a-province-you-lose-your-cores-on-that-land.1876496/](https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/when-conquistadors-take-over-a-province-you-lose-your-cores-on-that-land.1876496/)",

However, our slow season was unusually long this year and I was only getting 2-5 services a day. Sometimes none. So I’ve become very out of practice. \n\n  \nThis weekend, though, or busy season has started with about 40 services between me and my senior groomer (counting Friday, today, and tomorrow), and it is KILLING me. Holy crap. The holidays last year weren’t even this busy. \n\n  \nMy compression socks were torn up by my dog, my shoes need to be replaced, and my bras are ratty and uncomfortable. My legs hurt, my feet hurt, my back hurts…coming home and lying down even hurts. No time for eating and barely any time to sit. Too poor to get the things I need to be comfortable.\n\nHow do y’all recondition your body for this? How do you care for yourself when absolutely swamped? I love being busy but not when it means coming home and dreading movement. ",

    "selftext": "We talk a lot about apps, systems, and hacks—but one of the most underrated productivity tools is something most of us ignore:\n\n👉 **Your baseline mood.**  \nNot forced positivity. Not pretending everything’s fine.  \nJust getting yourself to feel **a tiny bit better** than you do right now.\n\nBecause here’s the truth backed by a ton of research:  \n**A slightly happier brain is a more productive brain.**  \nBetter focus, better memory, better problem-solving, better self-control.\n\nAnd you don’t need a retreat, a vacation, or a perfect life to get there.  \nYou just need **five minutes**.\n\nBelow is a quick routine I started using that consistently boosts my output without feeling like a “routine.”\n\n# 🕐 The 5-Minute Happiness-to-Productivity Routine\n\n# 1. 60-Second Reset\n\nThis one is stupidly simple.  \nBefore opening your laptop:\n\n* Take 5 slow breaths\n* Drop your shoulders\n* Unclench your jaw\n* Loosen your face\n\nWhen your body relaxes, your brain stops acting like it’s under attack.  \nFocus becomes way easier.\n\n# 2. 2-Minute “Things That Don’t Suck” List\n\nGratitude journaling sounds cringe to a lot of people, so do this instead.\n\nList **three things that don’t suck today**.  \nExamples:\n\n* “My coffee was good.”\n* “My chair is comfy.”\n* “I woke up on time.”\n\nIt’s micro-level gratitude.  \nIt shifts your brain from scanning for problems → scanning for possibilities.\n\n# 3. 90-Second Intention Lock\n\nWrite this sentence (yes, literally write it):\n\n**“Today will be a good day if I complete \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.”**\n\nJust one thing.  \nThis cuts overwhelm and gives your brain one clear target.  \nThe moment you fill in that blank, you know your priority.\n\n# 4. 30-Second Environment Tune-Up\n\nChange *one* thing around you:\n\n* Put your phone in another room\n* Remove 3 items from your desk\n* Open a window\n* Turn on a light\n\nOne tiny environmental shift = disproportionate productivity gain.\n\n# 🧠 Why This Works (the short version)\n\nHappiness isn’t something you get *after* being productive.  \nIt’s a **neurochemical head start** that makes productivity easier.\n\nYou don’t need to feel incredible.  \nYou just need to feel **2% better**.  \nThe compounding effect throughout your work session is huge.\n\n# If you try this today, let me know which part made the biggest difference.\n\nI’m curious whether people feel the boost more from the intention-setting or the physical reset.",

    "selftext": "If you want to take the time to listen to my little plot idea:\n\nSteve is a hermit. Alex is a bounty hunter. One day, Steve is minding his business when Alex breaks into his house and attacks him. After they stop fighting, Alex says she's there to arrest Steve for some insane crimes (burning villages or whatever). Steve denies ever doing them, but Alex doesn't believe him, showing him pictures of him doing that stuff. Steve is alarmed, because he didn't do those things, which meant somebody is impersonating him.\n\nAlex takes Steve to the Den of Thieves: a city of sorts, full of strange people who do strange things for a living. Alex presents Steve to the person who had a bounty on him: but they say it's not him. They say the Impostor had a more famished look, and had a sort of magical aura to him that Steve clearly didn't have. They say they won't pay Alex, because she got the wrong guy.\n\nAlex is frustrated and depressed at this news: she needed that money to live for the next week.  She can hardly find a good job, and at this rate, she'd starve to death before finding one.\n\nSteve, feeling bad, offers to help out: but he's barely making by himself-- all the crops have started to wilt, and all the animals have begun to disappear. Alex says the only job she could get was an impossible one: a shady buyer, probably a trophy collector, had offered a huge sum of money-- enough to last Alex her whole life, probably-- but asked for one impossible thing- a dragon egg. The last one left in all the realms was guarded by an Ender Dragon, the last of her kind. She was a fierce defender of her territory, and any adventurer who dared enter her nest would die before they could land a hit on her.\n\nSteve says they should get the egg.\n\nStandard banter-- \"Are you crazy!?\" \"Would you rather starve to death, or go out in a blaze of glory?\" \"Neither sounds good!\"\n\nEventually, considering how desperate she is, Alex agrees. She tells Steve to meet her at a nearby village at midnight, and asks him to have all his stuff ready. \n\nThey meet up, and their adventure to the End begins: it's a perilous one, filled with monsters, the undead, and labyrinthine ancient structures, but eventually, after many, many nights, through many, many biomes, including literal hell, they have everything they need to find the stronghold and go to the End. \n\nWhen they enter the End, they try to steal the Egg (which is on the bedrock pedestal thingy) without the dragon noticing, but it teleports away (loudly) which gets the dragon's attention. The fight with the dragon is a chaotic scuffle, with the pair trying to steal the egg, which keeps teleporting away (i know this doesn't happen in canon, but it makes for good stakes), dodge the dragon's attacks, and fight off the dragon. They eventually figure out that the crystals are healing the dragon, and then stop chasing after the egg and focus on destroying the crystals. When they finally defeat the dragon, its corpse lays dead near the egg. The pair can pick up the egg now, but as they bag it, they hear something rising behind them: the dragon, eyes glowing white, rises, and attacks again. Cue a second fight scene, and then, when the dragon dies, it rises into the air and bursts into a supernova of white light. \n\nSeason one would end with the pair selling the egg to the buyer, who has just collected a wither skull from another adventurer, and the two receive their money. Steve wants Alex to take it all, but Alex says they should split it. Steve is really grateful, and offers Alex a place to stay until she figures something out (maybe a line of dialogue earlier in the series could explain that Alex is homeless or smth idk). Maybe have a mid-credits scene of a village burning, and a dark figure in the distance with glowing white eyes, then end Season 1.\n\n  \nSeason 2 is all about Steve and Alex trying to figure out the identity of Steve's impostor. They investigate several weird areas that the impostor seems to have visited: villages abandoned without a soul in sight, entire forests of bare trees, strange altars built in the middle of nowhere, that kind of thing (there's gonna be heavy fog in all of these locations, and it would be cool if you could see a dark figure watching Steve and Alex from the distance, silhouetted against the fog). \n\nThe first half of the season could mostly be these investigations, with some filler episodes sprinkled in (like doing minor quests for different characters at the Den of Thieves), but each episode will have the two of them find or stumble upon one of these weird, foggy areas. The longer the season goes on, the more areas they find, and the more foggy home gets, until the second half of the season, where everywhere is foggy, everything is ruined in strange ways, and everyone is gone. The villages are all empty, the bustling Den of Thieves is pindrop silent. The animals are nowhere to be seen. Steve and Alex are the only ones left... well, almost the only ones left. As they're searching for people, they keep seeing a shadowy figure in the distance, but as they approached, he always disappeared before they could reach him. Except for the last time. That time, he turned to greet them. He was a thin, frail figure, with eyes as white as the sun... and Steve's face.\n\nIt was like a caricature of him-- gaunt and pale like a zombie, but wearing his skin. He called himself 'Herobrine'. Steve quickly realises this is his impostor, and quickly readies himself to fight. Herobrine is too strong for them, though, dodging their every attack, teleporting away when he had to. Steve and Alex are forced to retreat, and they brainstorm ways to defeat him. They keep moving, trying to keep as far away from Herobrine as possible until they could fight him-- and so, they ran into a small group of survivors: their names are Sunny, Zuri, Efe, Makena, Kai, Noor and Ari. They say they've had a run-in with Herobrine too, but they retreated rather than fighting. Sunny, who seems to be the redstone-expert of the group, says that his gadgets went haywire around him-- so he probably emitted a redstone signal, or at least, enough energy to be picked up by redstone tools. Sunny has been working on designing a device that could capture Herobrine's energy, and shows the blueprints to Steve: Sunny called it 'The Command Block'. \n\nHe said it needed some rare items to craft-- netherite scraps, found only in the nether. Steve says he and Alex will get some, and the two set off. The nether is empty too, and they see Herobrine again. They fight again, and lose again. Herobrine vanishes, and the pair search for ancient debris to mine down into scraps. They find just about enough and bring it back to Sunny, who spends the day crafting the device. It's an unstable prototype, though, and he says it'll take a few days to finish-- but they don't have a few days: Herobrine is here. \n\nThey use the prototype on Herobrine, and it redirects his attacks back at him. It seems to hurt him, though, so they fight until he's weak enough to destroy. His body collapses into a glowing cube-- the Orb of Dominance-- which Sunny traps inside the Command Block. Its power is too unstable, though, and it teleports away in a huge explosion.\n\nThe fog lifts, though, and people start appearing again-- waking up near the strange altars and barren lands. The crops begin to prosper as well, and the animals are more populated than ever before. The crew-- Steve, Alex, and the other survivors of Herobrine-- are relieved, and go about their regular lives-- but they meet up, talk about things, debate about the whereabouts of the Command Block-- they're friends now. Officially. Season Two ends with another mid-credits scene: the shady dealer from season one, scouring his many chests. We see him open one, and from it, he produces three wither skulls.\n\n  \nI'll write Season 3 later, probably in a comment.",

    "selftext": "I overcame paruresis, except in a specific situation.\n\nI'm 29, and already had to deal with a social anxiety when I was around 18. I managed to collect some life hacks to avoid being in a bad situation.\n\nFirst of all, I had to develop a \"self-preservation bladder\" plan to avoid having to go to the bathroom when I'm outside:\n\n* Always bring a bottle of water before leaving to avoid dehydration in case of panic attack\n* Protect yourself against the cold\n* Pee twice before leaving\n* Do not drink before leaving, or do it more than 10 minutes before leaving.\n* If you're thirsty, drink one small sip and let it the time to hydrate you before drinking again, so you won't drink too much\n* Once you're outside, avoid thinking and panicking about it. Try to focus on other things.\n\nIf despite that, you'll definitively need to pee while you're outside, you need to find public toilets:\n\n* In churches\n* In cemeteries\n* In train/bus stations (may not be free in some places)\n\nOnce you're there, think like you just came home, and that you can finally release your bladder. That's how I did in my previous job. When you get along with the people working here, it become easier to feel like you're home. So you have to trick your mind that you're at home.\n\nI also used some tactics, if the door doesn't indicate if the toilets are occupied, like in North America, I hum something random, like this place is my place ~~Assert dominance~~\n\nOne position that I adopted was to sit, and look at the top of the door. It's also useful to have something to distract yourself, like a phone or a map of the world. You can also try to do math, like counting the number of dots on the toilet paper, it's very distracting.\n\nDespite all of this, I cannot pee when a group of people, including me, have to prepare to leave a place. It's not that I have a \"shy bladder\" like paruresis is often called, it's that my brain tells my body that it's not the time, I'm making other people wait. So I have to prepare for the moment earlier.",

    "selftext": "Just a cool fight that I felt like posting. I'm posting the YT link instead of the video itself because the fight took 6 minutes, but it was pretty fucking epic. Crane's fight was even more epic, honestly, since it ended with one second remaining and because I only ended up winning due to the last hit being a crit. I was sad to not have recorded it, so I chose not to make the same mistake with Hermit. This one wasn't an unarmed fight, though. Still, the sai are also a pretty underrated weapon (as well as my second favorite in the game). And holy moly, that last round was tense!\nThe helmet is just for show, since it doesn't really do much. It's probably 3 or 4 levels below mine, so yeah. Essentially, for me, head hit = death.\nThe armor was upgraded, though, as it would have been literally impossible to beat eclipse Crane in time without upgrades.\n\nPeople don't usually talk about how doing the long step forward is actually a pretty damn useful avading move. If you're close enough, it's very effective to just do a quick attack like \"up + kick\", then immediately step forward through the opponent to hit them from the back, since they will usually try to retaliate like an idiot, so it's essentially a free hit. I've learned this from observing the NPCs dirty tactics. Hermit succesfully avoided that move for most of the fight, though, either because he didn't take the bait or because he got lucky.",

    "title": "Is the community overly harsh on the Director's Cut? -- Value for money, and the delisting of OGY0.",
    "selftext": "**----I am NOT defending SEGA's recent decisions.**\n\nSo as probably everyone here has seen, our beloved OG version of Yakuza 0 is going to be delisted from stores to be replaced with the Director's Cut version on the 8th of December 2025, and of course, many fans are ardently against this, and calling Y0DC \"a worse way to play\".\n\nNow I want to say right out the gate, I believe $50 is too high of an asking price for Y0DC, I personally believe $35 would be the upper limit of an acceptable price.  \nHow did I come to that figure? Well, just think about what this version adds to the game, and how much value you believe that holds, then tack on another $5 because profit, shareholders, blah blah money.\n\n\\-\n\n**--What you get with Y0DC:**\n\n**Redlight Raid Mode.**  \nThis online co-op game mode might not be anything groundbreaking, but it's still a fun little addition that you can play with your friends, even if you only get a couple hours of playtime out of it. How much would you be willing to pay for something like this if it were its own standalone thing? Probably not more than $5, but hey, it can still be a good time.\n\n**An English (and Chinese) Voice Dub.**  \nI don't understand why there are people that genuinely seem to be mad over games getting dubbed into more languages, these games being more accessible to more people is a GOOD thing. Yes, some of the casting choices could be better, but that's not the topic right now.  \nThere are plenty of reasons why a person might prefer to play a game with English voice acting over the original Japanese, maybe they struggle to keep up with the text speed, maybe they have bad eyesight, maybe they don't want to have to think too hard, maybe they just prefer to play in English. Whatever the reason, having it as an option is only going to invite more players into the series.\n\n**Several new text languages.**  \nJust like with the dub, the addition of more text languages opens up the game to more people, these kinds of additions are always a good thing.\n\n**Higher quality textures, Autosave, and Save anywhere.**  \nProbably didn't take much dev time, there were already mods for the OG game that did this, but still good to have.\n\n**The same great game we've loved for 10 years.**  \nIf you believe that Yakuza 0 is a great game that should be enjoyed by as many people as possible, well guess what? Y0DC is the SAME game with a little bit of added content...\n\n**28 minutes of new cutscenes.**  \nSo this is where the main backlash of Y0DC comes from, the added cutscenes, and having watched all of the cutscenes I can say with my whole chest:  \nONLY **ONE** OF THE NEW CUTSCENES IS ACTUALLY BAD, THE REST ARE FINE EVEN IF THEY'RE POINTLESS.  \nThe scene I'm talking about is of course, the scene in which Majima is informed that &gt;!Lee survived the car bomb!&lt;. Now, I'm not a medical  professional, but that seems pretty far fetched to me, but on the other hand, the Yakuza universe clearly isn't our own, and &gt;!Lee surviving this attack is hardly the first time we've seen someone come back from something that should have resulted in their death, and even then, Lee is very badly hurt, wrapped in bandages, and is likely to die very soon after that incident!&lt;, so I can actually forgive the game for that. My real issue with this scene is the fact that they felt the need to bring up &gt;!Makoto's watch!!&lt;  \n&gt;!Reminding the player that Majima has the watch, and spelling out to us that he's going to get it fixed for her really does spoil the post credit scene with her!&lt;, and if I could remove one singular thing from Y0DC, it would be this.  \nThat said, I still don't believe this scene is so bad that it somehow ruins the entire game.\n\n\\-\n\n**--The Delisting of the OG Yakuza 0:**\n\nIs anyone surprised? Really, actually surprised by this?  \nSEGA aren't exactly known for allowing 2 versions of the same game to be available for purchase on digital platforms at the same time. You can't buy the PS2 versions of Yakuza 1, or 2, and you can't buy the OG versions of Yakuza 3, 4, or 5. Only the Kiwami and Remastered version of those games can be bought digitally.  \nI know people have pointed to the Persona games having both their OG + Remastered versions, but those games are made by Atlus, who were acquired by SEGA in 2013, there is very likely a greater degree of separation between Atlus and SEGA than there is between RGG and SEGA.\n\nI'm not going to try and pretend that this is anything other than a cash grab on SEGA's part, it's clear that they just want to make as much money from Y0DC as they can, and know that it'd be much harder to sell DC if the OG version were sitting right next to it at less than half the price.  \nThe reason why Y0 \"has\" to be delisted from PS4 and XBOne is because the game is backwards compatible - there'd be no way of stopping someone from buying the PS4 version and playing it on PS5.  \nIf possible, the upgrades from Y0 to Y0DC should have just been DLC packages for the OG games (same can be said for the Kiwami upgrades), even if they wouldn't be able to run on the PS3 version.\n\n**-**\n\n**--TLDR;**  \nY0DC isn't nearly as bad as people make it out to be.  \nThe upgrades for Y0, Kiwami, and Kiwami 2 should be DLC.",

So you have to save your girlfriend and the world from this chinese guy named long who want to achieve god power by some ancient artifact.\n\nReview:\n\nThe just copies mechanics and gameplay from other games like I can clearly they mostly have the same weapon from god of war and sepecial attacks, you have a comedic companion which I think is copied from crash bandicoot and the anicent ruin, you have mario like story like wtf can't this game can have anything new. The only thing I think they added new was that you can control your enemies. I gotta say I encounter no bugs in the game and gameplay feel fluid but we it turns call of duty sometime like we have to use a machine gun or sometime it becomes those arcade fighter jet shooter like wtf man what this game trying to become does want to become god of war, call of duty or any other game that copies from but still it fails. The last good thing I can say about this game was the voice acting it is pretty good. The bosses aren't that hard what I think was hard was normal enemies that made them very hard like you can kill one after 15 or 20 hits, the combat is just sluggish.\n\nConclusion:\n\nPlay this game if you get bored of the og god of war as it fail in every aspects. It has zero innovation and it is just a wanna be god of war. I will say that the game is a good mix of action and comedy but I don't recommend it. The difficulty is not challenging and the combat feels sluggish.\n\nReview:\n\nI give it a 6.5/10.",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone,\nI’ve been working on a fully autonomous token system on BSC and I’d appreciate some dev feedback before moving forward with audits and marketing.\n\nThe concept was simple at first — but it grew into a multi-contract architecture with no owner control, no minting, and two independent reward vaults that operate without manual triggers.\n\nHere’s the full structure:\n\n• JackpotToken\n– Fair-launch, no owner once renounced\n– Buy tax → automatically funds two vaults\n– Sell lock, cooldown, max wallet tied to LP liquidity\n– 8-stage LP thresholds\n– Anti-sybil, anti-bot behavior\n– Auto-LP via router with burnt LP tokens\n\n\n• Buyer Jackpot Vault\n– 8 circular buffers × 512 entries (4096 capacity)\n– Snapshot + reveal approach (delayed entropy)\n– 100% pot payout\n– Eligibility based on token balance + BNB buy value\n\n\n• LP Jackpot Vault (top 50 contributors)\n– Dual-pot: top 10 get 75%, next 40 get 25%\n– Uses double-buffer participant separation\n– Finalization only allowed by participants\n\n\n• LPManager\n– Prevents direct pancake LP to avoid eligibility bypass\n– Slippage-safe addLiquidity wrapper\n\n\n• SwapHelper\n– 1-click buy with any of 17 supported tokens\n– Token → BNB → JACK route, with dynamic slippage\n\n\nThe goal was to create a fully autonomous token where the community drives the jackpots through volume, without centralized control or a team wallet.\n\nIf you see:\n• any potential attack vectors\n• MEV vulnerabilities\n• reentrancy points I may have missed\n• economic exploits\n• issues with LP thresholds logic\n• any gas optimizations\n\nYour feedback would mean a lot. I’ve been building this system alone for months and a second pair of dev eyes would be extremely helpful.\n\nNot promoting anything — just sharing and validating architecture before final push.\n\n\nhttps://bscscan.com/address/0xf9cca4a82f06633ba14ff838078826dbbc504a96\n\nhttps://bscscan.com/address/0xd2ac676fd8bc2d1541fe243b10dca02161fa0e71\n\nhttps://bscscan.com/address/0xab75663a70b4d7d49345a5e6bea0bc9969a4e41e\n\nhttps://bscscan.com/address/0x1e256cc4039d30f0b097d25739ce85e23a1701bc\n\nhttps://bscscan.com/address/0x9833af2f3e0ff94024f0e1339269af632053fc86",

    "title": "I (25 Gay Man) feel increasingly politically disconnected from the LGBTQ+ community",
    "selftext": "Do you feel increasingly politically disconnected from the LGBTQ+ community?\n\nHello, I wanted to share my feelings about the LGBTQ+ community and get your opinions. As a young, white, gay man, I feel less and less like I belong to the \"LGBTQ\" community, just hearing the letters makes me feel depressed. The events of recent years and the discussions I've had with other LGBT people have deeply shocked me. I literally didn't agree with them on anything.\n\nTo begin with, I think our community has gone astray by supporting political struggles in the Middle East, particularly Hamas and the Palestinians. A fight that I consider illusory and even suicidal on the part of LGBT people. Supporting Islam and their religious freedom? Seriously??? Supporting their genocide of Jews and their annihilation of the only non-homophobic democracy in the Islamic world? Seriously??? Justifying the massacres of October 7th with the excuse \"They asked for it\" or \"It's resistance\"!!! Seriously???\n\nI also think the movement is paralyzed by crazy lesbians with green hair and transgender people who are leading the entire movement into political agendas that no longer aim to promote the right to live freely and without judgment, but rather to redefine the biological nature of sex.\n\nNot to mention the support, which I consider insane, for Marxist and communist economic and financial doctrines. These doctrines are profoundly harmful to economic and technological development, to human rights, and to civil liberties (which concerns us gay men). History has shown us that gulags are systematic with these economic theories.\n\nI think this is completely isolating the movement on the far left, close to the revolutionary fringe of society, the anti-Western, anti-colonialist, anti-Christian, and anti-capitalist fringes.\n\nI am absolutely outraged when I see far-left \"activists\" promoting certain political positions that have nothing to do with gay men but rather advocate for an ideology and support specific racial, religious, and political groups. They presume to speak on behalf of homosexuals while seizing our flag.\n\nSeriously, 40 years ago, we couldn't live honestly because we would have been fired from our jobs and homes. Discrimination was severe, and our equality and freedom were certainly not won through embrace of economic Marxism, political Islam, immigration policies, or even support for the redefinition of biological \"gender.\" I'm worried because those in \"control\" (Often Lesbians et trans with green hair) of the LGBT movement are actually isolating us in a madhouse of revolutionary far-left extremism.\n\nThe other day I saw people clashing in front of an abortion clinic, an anti-abortion crowd vs a pro-abortion crowd, and what did I see? A woman with short orange hair covered in piercings, waving a rainbow flag (not the original one created by Gilbert Baker). It was the new, racialized, woke version of the flag, the one with trans, intersex, and anti-racist colors, created by Valentino Vecchietti in May 2021. I think that intersectionality is madness, mixing trans people, black people, with feminism, with gay people is doing a disservice to gay men. Fighting to live as a gay man in consensual relationships with another man, without legal persecution, is not the same as defending the idea that biological sex does not exist and that it is possible to choose one's sex.\n\nTrans activism, which presents sex as a matter of \"spectrum,\" completely breaks with the original struggle of gay men for freedom.\n\nI am also completely astonished by all the other terms used after the letter Q to define not a man who loves another man, but rather \"disturbed mental conditions,\" each more different than the last.\n\nAs a young white man, I absolutely do not support any of the anti-white rhetoric that aims to accuse white people of every imaginable wrongdoing. Using terms like \"white tears,\" \"white fragility,\" \"white privilege,\" \"colonizers,\" or any other form of anti-white rhetoric.\n\nI completely reject all these woke theories that aim to insult white people. And I, for one, will not apologize for being white, nor for what my ancestors did or didn't do.\n\nI also know that as a young white man in my twenties, my generation, young men in general are increasingly moving towards the conservative side, which is the exact opposite of women in general, who are becoming far left. Statistics clearly show the ideological divide that separates young men and young women.\n\nAs a gay man, what do you think of the direction of the \"LGBT movement\" and the positions taken in recent years?\n\nPlease, I await your opinions. As for me, I personally think that it is up to us gay men to set limits in this movement and especially to take (for those who have the capacity) measured and realistic political positions on international and societal issues, in order not to leave the field open to far-left propagandists and revolutionaries.",

Then you go watch the movie or show adaptation only to find out they cast somebody who does not fit the originally intended description you grew accustomed to, at all. \n\nWhy do they do that?\n\nIt’s rather annoying. And I’m not being racist about it, because had a character been described as dark skinned with a thick accent, then they cast some white dude? I’d be just as upset. \n\nWhy do they change things if people notoriously complain? I’ve never once seen an adaptation of a story that was 100% accurate to how the characters were supposed to look. (Maybe I have and can’t recall but that would still add to the argument that there are too few in existence) there are so many multitudes of actors in this world, plus CGI, we can definitely accurate depict these characters, we just don’t…. I don’t understand. It’s not always about diversity either because sometimes characters are changed into white people too so what heck… ",

    "title": "Peter's Bigass Patreon FAQ",
    "selftext": "Hi guys, Peter the Documentarian posted a massive \"FAQ\" on Patreon. I have no idea what posting it privately on the Patreon will even do so here it is if you want to read it and not give Peter money. Post stars below, \"(redacted)\" is from the original so nothing is left out.\n\n\\---\n\nDear (redacted), \n\nThank you for reaching out. Before answering these questions, it’s important that your community understand how we got here.\n\nFor fifteen years, my wife was a vet tech but she became ill and could no longer work. We were living on a farm that we weren’t using to its potential so we decided to create an animal care rescue and sanctuary that would focus on animals that other rescues couldn’t take – the badly injured, disabled, dying, pregnant, and more. Julien and I created Blue Barn Rescue &amp; Sanctuary with my wife Mary at the helm. She has saved and re-homed hundreds of animals in the short time we have been operating. Julien and I thought we could help all sorts of nonprofits with some of our learnings from this experience. So, we created Delepine Creative to help nonprofits in a variety of ways, including finding innovative fundraising projects. One idea we had was to assist organizations helping victims of crime and DV to raise money by making a film in the true crime space and sending any proceeds towards those organizations.\n\nWe reached out to several high profile inmates whose cases we though deserved more exploration. Srah responded and off we went.\n\nAbout a year ago, a YouTube creator came upon my name in jail house call logs and emails and began pushing a narrative claiming I was making a pro-Sarah Boone film, that I was funding her, and that any profits would go to Sarah. Some of her viewers were also led to believe I had used a racist slur. None of this was true, but the misinformation spread faster than we could correct it. \n\nIn June, I reached out to her directly. I stated clearly that: we were not supporting or funding Sarah, that the documentary project had ended, I had never used racist language, and that my family and our animal rescue were being harassed. I closed with asking her to stop and in case there was any ambiguity, I offered to speak with her directly.\n\nShe declined. \n\nInstead, she told her audience that beginning my letter with “Dear \\[her first name\\]” was somehow threatening, sexist, and possibly racist. And (after being told my wife was ill and we were being harassed), she suggested Mary may have written the email herself. She omitted the section of my letter that disproved her claims and never told her audience I had asked to speak directly. Predictably, the harassment escalated. In subsequent videos she labeled me a liar, grifter, and scammer, used my name and image in her thumbnails, and jumped into comment sections across multiple channels to reinforce the same narrative. All of this is documented. Anyway, that is the context. Let’s get your community some answers!\n\nBelow are ten of the most frequently asked question we saw on Patreon. Following are all the questions you sent me from Reddit. There is some overlap but it is important you share all of them.\n\n**ONE. Were you making a pro–Sarah Boone documentary?** \n\nNo. The goal from day one was simple: get access, gather primary-source material, and package the project with funding, a director, and a crew. We never reached the stage where a director could challenge her or develop a thesis.\n\n**TWO.  Why release the calls now?** \n\nBy June, it was clear studios weren’t going to fund the project. Over the summer, we explored a YouTube docu-series but by its end, it was clear Sarah wasn’t going to meaningfully participate or answer questions. At that point, we ended our involvement with her and chose transparency with the material we had. \n\n**THREE. Why release the journal?** \n\nThe journal is unauthenticated, meaning we cannot confirm whether what she wrote is true, false, or somewhere in between. It should be approached with skepticism. We have made that clear. It is disputed and difficult to read, but it does exist in the historical record of this case. Our responsibility is to present disputed material with context, not bury it. Journalists and documentarians do this every day. It’s standard practice. \n\n**FOUR. Did Sarah want you to release the calls or the journal?** \n\nNo. But we have full rights and control and the option to do so. We released them to provide transparency and to advance the original purpose of the project: contribute meaningfully to the public discourse and raise money for nonprofits.\n\n**FIVE. Are you funding Sarah Boone?** \n\nNo. The contract makes that explicit: she had no influence and received no financial gain. Any small commissary deposits were made at the request of third parties. The money we spent over a year was limited to stamps, writing materials, shipping, and two modest holiday gifts for her son, a simple kindness for a child going through a difficult time.  \n\n**SIX. Why did you offer to help with attorneys?** \n\nBecause Sarah had no access to representation, her files, or writing materials. Regardless of how one feels about her, the justice system should not function that way. We also consulted family-law attorneys and researched the process. Dual representation is often more fair, more efficient, less expensive, as well as less traumatic for children. But when we learned the Son of Sam law could complicate things — and after no attorney would take her case — we stepped back and limited our involvement to administrative logistics. Yes, this blurred the line between investigator and participant. We accept that criticism. We also stand by our intentions. \n\n**SEVEN. Why won’t you release unedited versions of the calls?** \n\nThe only edits made were for: \n\n* audio distortion \n* overlapping or repeated segments \n* legal details that could affect ongoing cases \n* personal identifying information \n* sensitive business information \n\nNothing was removed to shape her narrative. \n\n**EIGHT. Why didn’t you challenge her more directly?** \n\nBecause doing so would have ended the access immediately. These calls were groundwork, not a finished documentary. A director would challenge her later.  And realistically: if someone thinks they can befriend a narcissistic murderer, keep access, and aggressively confront inconsistencies at the same time, I’d love to read that playbook. \n\n**NINE. Why link donations to domestic-violence causes?** \n\nWe didn’t. Donations were always intended for victims of crime and never Sarah or her narrative. The misunderstanding came from misinformation circulating at the time. In hindsight, we should have anticipated that confusion. Going forward, charitable giving will not be connected to this case. \n\n**TEN. Why wait so long to address everything publicly?** \n\nBecause we had no platform. When we tried to clarify things in June, it went nowhere. Aside from your Reddit thread, only one YouTuber ever contacted us- with disrespectful questions and a warning that “people on Reddit are coming for you.” You deserved answers earlier. We appreciate Emily reaching out and for the opportunity now. \n\n**ELEVEN. Why and how did things end with Sarah?** \n\nBecause it became clear she had no intention of participating in a documentary or answering the questions required for one. After a year of communication, it was obvious we were being used to fill gaps in her legal work. You can hear that frustration in my final email to her.  I’m not proud of the tone of that email. I was angry and disappointed. Some wording was harsher than it should have been. But the message stands:  If Sarah wants to be heard, she has to tell the truth about what happened that night. Without that, there was no ethical way to continue. \n\n**DIRECT REDDIT QUESTION ANSWERS:**\n\n**#1. Did you watch the trial, and did it have an impact on your view of Sarah? Following the verdict, did her attitude, mood, or communication pattern change?**\n\nYes, I watched the trial. No, it didn’t change my view of Sarah. What I saw in court was the same person I had been dealing with privately — no emotional shift, no new tone, no real change in how she communicated. She was consistently Sarah. A very difficult, very challenging personality from start to finish.\n\n**#2: Did they start off thinking Sarah wasn't guilty of murder? If so, was there a moment during the trial that changed their mind? Regardless their opinion on her guilt or innocence, was there a particular moment when they realized there was something deeply wrong with her personality?**\n\nWe went in already believing she was guilty and that she had major personality issues. Honestly, anyone watching the suitcase video and the interrogation can see something is profoundly off. There was no big reveal for us. It was baked in from day one.\n\n**#3a: If you meant to document domestic abuse, at what point did you realize Jorge was the real victim and that Boone was a malignant narcissist?**\n\nWe always believed she was abusive. The journal is disputed, which complicates things, but none of that changes her culpability. It does raise interesting questions about her mental health and sentencing, but again it doesn’t rewrite the fundamental facts. And its release was never meant to.\n\n **#3b. When you realized that, what changed in how you handled her? Also, did you start recording right away or only when your “spidey senses” activated?**\n\nThe recordings weren’t ever for public release. They were for note-taking and possible B-roll. I started recording in December simply because I wanted to be meticulous. We planned to bring in a director, a proper crew, interview both families, doctors, experts the full documentary process. But we never got that far.\n\n**#4 How are you selecting which calls to release? Why aren’t they in chronological order?**\n\nI wish I could say it was some mysterious artistic choice, but honestly  a lot of the recordings are a mess. I work full-time on a farm, and a bunch of the calls were happening while I was building a barn for rescued goats, sheep, and horses. There’s construction noise, animals yelling at me, the whole circus. I’ve been picking the calls I could clean up the fastest that also give the best insight into her personality. Now that everything is organized, we will start sequencing them properly.\n\n**#5a. I’m curious how abusive was she? Would she instantly turn verbally abusive when she did get her way or was she more manipulative in order to get her way? What was the worst thing she said or did during your time with her??**\n\nShe wasn’t explosively abusive but she was manipulative, self-centered, and transactional. Some emails were rude, but I’ve got thick skin, so it bounced off me. The cruelest moment to me was her reaction to Lana’s death. She sent: “FYI: Lana died.” That hit Julien hard. He has a recording of the call, and we’re trying to find it. For him, that was the breaking point.\n\n**#5b: As a corollary to this, did you ever witness Sarah actually cry? All we've ever seen Sarah do is put on this shaky voice where she discusses crying a whole lot, but never actually gets around to actually crying. So did you ever witness tears or a runny nose or anything that real crying would entail?**\n\nI only met her once in person at sentencing. Everything else was over the phone. All the “crying” you’ve heard is the same style I heard. She could switch from “crying” to perfectly normal in seconds. But to be fair, she’s in prison and showing weakness isn’t an option there, so some of that might be for her own self- protection.\n\n**#6: Do you know what deal did James Owens have worked out with Sarah for payment? Why do you think Lana and Nicole were drawn to her? Did you find anyone who had something good to say about her?**\n\nI don’t know the financial deal. My understanding is he did it pro bono. As for why Lana and Nicole stuck around I don’t know. They’re kind, big-hearted people. Some folks who’ve survived difficult relationships are drawn toward people that share the qualities of their abusers. Maybe it is a desire to “fix” something, or understand it, or just feel less alone? I don’t know but I don’t think they deserve the hate they get.\n\n**#7: Has Sarah, even in passing, acknowledged that alcohol was an issue for her? We know she’s blamed alot on Jorge’s alcohol abuse, but, has she ever admitted her alcohol abuse.**\n\nNo. On one call she says she can’t wait to have a margarita on the beach. Then comes the sound of my jaw hitting the ground.\n\n**#8a: Would love to know why these specific calls were released? Were other calls recorded? If not why just these?**\n\nWe have many more calls. These were chosen because they were clear, audible, and offered useful insight. We removed some material for geal reasons and business reasons. But, plenty more are coming.\n\n**#8b: Is there one from just after sentencing?**\n\nYes. That is coming soon.\n\n**#8c: I guess my question is why now? Given the short time since the last email (work of art btw) &amp; starting to release the calls it feels almost knee jerk. Plus the sequence of the calls are rather discombulating for me, is there a plan to explain the sequence?**\n\nWe were overwhelmed in the beginning and the calls were a disorganized mess. The ones you’ve seen were the “low-hanging fruit”. These are the ones that were the easiest to cleanup and offered the best insight.  Now that everything’s sorted, we’re aiming to go in sequence. But most importantly: these calls were never meant for the documentary.\n\n**#9: What was the hardest part of dealing with her?**\n\nGassing her up. Telling her what she wanted to hear, not what she needed to hear. It was transactional and it didn’t feel great. I remember telling her she has a place on my farm when she gets out. I told her we named a duck after her. Imagine that. It is impossibly cringey without knowing the context. I absolutely sacrificed a piece of my integrity doing it.\n\n**#10: Why were you made Power of Attorney?**\n\nI wasn’t. She offered it, and I immediately regretted saying yes. When she asked if I got the paperwork, I lied and said it never arrived. It had. I just wasn’t signing it. When we eventually argued about my “not helping enough,” I used that moment to officially reset the boundary and decline. It was a game between maintaining access and hanging on until I could pass the baton.\n\n**#11: I mean this sincerely and whole heartedly. How did you survive Sarah Boone? Were there moments you wanted to bang your head against a wall? Scream out loud to the ether? We feel that already just from reading her dialogue at a distance.**\n\nThank you for the concern, genuinely. But, I went in knowing who she was. And for me, it was a business arrangement, not a personal one. The minute I realized she wasn’t going to participate, I bounced.\n\n**#12. If this was being done as a potential documentary, was there ever an attempt at speaking to Jorge’s family? Do you feel you have a responsibility to tell the true story now, with a spotlight on the real victim, Jorge? While the family may not want any involvement, have you attempted to apologize for assisting Jorge’s murderer? After this experience, what will you do differently going forward (personally or in a business mindset)?**\n\nWe did speak with Vitoria. At sentencing, during Sarah’s speech, she got up and left. Julien followed her out and had a nice conversation with her. He told her what we were doing and why it was important to have her and her family involved. She agreed and they traded numbers. After that, we sent several text messages but she did not reply. I assume that perhaps she saw all the speculation about our intentions and she didn’t reach back. I can understand why. Or maybe she and her family were tired and grieving. Either way I didn’t want to keep bothering her. I respected her privacy.\n\nYes, I will do everything differently!  This was the first documentary I was attempting to make. I learned a lot.  \n\n**#13: Does/Did Sarah receive any financial benefit from this project? Can the viewers receive full transparency to ensure they are not indirectly supporting Sarah? Would they agree it is a conflict of interest to be a power of attorney over the subject of their documentary? How have they maintained journalistic integrity while having close companionship with the subject of the documentary?**\n\nShe has never benefited financially. I’m open to sharing the contract with Emily to verify that. And yup, being POA would have been a conflict. That’s one reason I didn’t sign. That and I didn’t want to be involved with Sarah any more than I already was. It is like a slippery slope with her…give an inch and she take a mile. But she wanted me to have the POA because there were things she needed for her case (like the files) that were difficult to get.\n\n**#14: In addition to information Sarah self reported to you, what additional information, outside interviews, records request, etc did you conduct?**\n\nWe spoke with her attorneys, her doctor, her investigator, inmate friends, non-inmate friends, some family members, and others. But the heavy research , the part where you pull every record and interview every expert, would’ve happened after we got funding and after hiring a director.\n\n**#15: Did Sarah ever provide or come clean with more details about what actually happened that night?**\n\nNo. And that’s the biggest disappointment. We never reached those conversations. I still believe there’s so much more to the story. And that is partly why we are releasing these calls and emails, to keep the conversation alive. Maybe one of you all can get some answers. Otherwise, why are we all here?\n\n**#16: Why on earth didnt they (Peter?) tell her how horrible and vindictive her sentencing speech was when she read it to him?**\n\nBecause I didn’t want to influence her. I told her the truth: I didn’t think it would change the sentence, and people did expect remorse. But I wanted her to reveal herself unfiltered. Editing her into someone more sympathetic would have been dishonest.\n\n**#17: I have several questions. 1) when approximately did the case catch their attention? 2) How did they initially reach out to Sarah? 3)How much research about the case was done before approaching her?**\n\nIt caught our attention the day it hit the news. We reached out by letter. There wasn’t a ton of material then, but we researched what existed and built a basic concept which, in hindsight, was very bland. But nature of the beast - documentaries tend to evolve as the truth unfolds.\n\n**#18: Did she ever talk about her alcohol use? Knowing what a drunk she was, and knowing that she had such an interesting reaction to being asked about withdrawals I am curious if there has been any talk of her addiction. 5) Has there been any attempt to speak to anyone other than Sarah or Lana?**\n\nNo, and I apologize this is an answer for many of these. We really never got to that point. It was an interview where we had one bite at the apple. It was a slow play, building trust and getting her to that point. Maybe after she loses her appeal and has nothing else left but truth, she’ll come around. IDK.    \n\n**#19: What, out of purely morbid curiosity, is the most absolutely unhinged thing that she has said in their conversations? Not necessarily the most cruel or mean, but the one thing that just left them thinking \"what the heck?\". Or even... just because I have a very deep hatred of Sarah, what was the most incredibly stupid thing she has ever said.**\n\nHonestly, the suitcase video says it all. But she also had this habit of immediately praising me in a way that felt performative. Once, I used the phrase “arrow in my quiver,” and suddenly I became a genius in her eyes. Moments like that were revealing about how she manipulates people in her day to day. Her other tactic is just bombarding people with BS. In normal life I think she got away with it because people would just say “OK, fine, we will accept your discount coupon even though it is expired,” while unable to roll their eyes hard enough (props Sofa Squad). But it didn’t work this time.\n\n**#20: Did you record every call? And if so, will you release them? (Pretty please.....)**\n\nHaven’t recorded every call, but many. And yes, we plan to release everything we have. Lots of it make me look terrible and I cringe but there was strategy behind it. We got into this for all of to learn something and for better or worse, we are gonna continue. Thanks to the open minded.\n\n**#21a: Why did you tell Sarah you were her friend? Why did you do so much for her?**\n\nAnswered above  but in short: it was transactional for access, but also rooted in my belief that even the guilty deserve due process. I know not everyone will agree, and that’s okay.\n\n**#21B. Why did you misrepresent who you were and edit the phone calls? Why not be fully transparent???**\n\nWhen we posted the first videos, we were getting hammered by people accusing us of being “Team Sarah.” I was trying to protect my privacy and my farm, after already losing donors. It wasn’t handled well, and I’m sorry for that. One of many mistakes.\n\n**#22: The stated purpose for posting the videos is to \"spark real conversations\". So why do they turn off the comments for the vids?**\n\nBecause early on we were hit with accusations that we were spreading Sarah’s propaganda. Some people tracked down my farm website and harassed us  and we were already struggling with funding for our rescue animals. We turned comments off to stop the dogpile. And, we expect and want other channels to use our content, and conversations can happen there. But this is like shoveling sand back into the ocean and it didn’t help.  They should be on now since we came back to YT\n\n**#23: My question. Can they understand that the 'journal' is objectionable because the victim is villified? It should not be published in any version?**\n\nI completely understand why people feel that way. But journalists *do* release disputed material  with disclaimers. We did the same. It’s on Patreon only, not YouTube, and labeled clearly as unverified. We’re still deciding whether to continue publishing them. Perhaps we can have a Reddit session to discuss this topic.\n\n**#24: What was her reaction to being found guilty and sentenced to life?**\n\nShe was pretty numb. We have that call and we are working on it.\n\n**#25. Why would anyone actually try to help her with her family law case or anything at all?**\n\n Because the justice system should work for everyone, even the guilty. She had no pen, no paper, no attorney, no files. I reached out to 23 law firms. All declined. Only one person spoke with her and they bailed because she was so difficult. All the nonprofits declined to get involved one way pr another. She had no ability to defend herself.\n\n**#26: Did she talk to you about the plea deal and if so, what did she say? Did she waver at all on taking it?**\n\nThis is  great question. Good news is the call was recorded. I’m still searching for it. To put it mildly, her response is wild.\n\n**#27: What do you know about her childhood, education, romantic relationships, if any, beyond brian and jorge, marital history &amp; work history? Did you ever talk to her about why she never made a serious effort to find work to contribute to her own support? Did she have a plan for supporting herself when alimony ended? Do you have theories about why she is the way she is (eg. lacking empathy; being without insight, etc.). Did she ever in her life have mental therapy or counseling and/or therapy related to alcoholism?**\n\nWe never got deep enough into the project to cover those subjects. And, I wasn’t supposed to. My aim was to keep her invested and maintain access.\n\n**#28.  I would ask them Why did you let her treat you disrespectfully like that?**\n\nSee earlier answers. It was strategic and transactional.\n\n**#29: My question: Given that you actively aided and abetted an abuser’s attempts to continue abusing her victims (ex-husband and son) from prison, why do you feel you are entitled to profit off your actions?**\n\nThis project was never a money-maker. Documentaries rarely are. The goal was truth and to donate proceeds to nonprofits helping victims.\n\n**#30: Why didn't they post the breakup email first so we'd know where they were at with Sarah from the start?**\n\n“Breakup email”. Lol. In candor we were figuring things out as we went, and we’re new at this. We didn’t want to defend ourselves and we wanted what we had to speak for itself. We never wanted to be a part of the story. We never wanted to direct the story. But here we are in the middle of it. We agree some context is needed because all of the distortion. It’s going up soon, right after we put up a video summarizing this Q&amp;A video.\n\n**#31: Are they in therapy to recover from close and prolonged contact with the insufferable monster?**\n\nThanks and yes. For that and other things. :)\n\n**#32. Does Sarah have any redeeming qualities at all?**\n\n“Redeeming” is strong, but she does have traits worth noting. She’s extremely hard-working and very resilient. I think she after some time, she will do well in prison. I also believe she genuinely loves her son. I suspect severe past trauma shaped who she became. And that is sad.\n\n**#33: Will he donate any of the money he makes from Patreon to the Torres family?**\n\nProceeds won’t be publicly tied to this case due to all the distortion. But we *are* donating to organizations helping victims of crime, and suggestions are welcome.\n\n**#34: Why releasing the prison journals knowing she's a liar? Why let her victimize the Torres family all over again?**\n\nAnswered above. We labeled everything as unverified and a big warning. We are still deciding how to move forward. I would be open to having an open conversation on your thread.\n\n**#35: Did Sarah Boone tell either of you anything about the events of that night that has never been revealed elsewhere?**\n\nNo. But we wanted to get there. That’s one of the big regrets.\n\n**#36: Is this the true narcissist you have dealt with? How did her narcissistic PD change the way you interacted with her?**\n\nIt never changed anything because we always knew this. It was a game of maintaining access long enough to get funding and hand her off to a director who could actually challenge her story while the tape was rolling.\n\n**#37a: My question for ThirdRail Were you drawn to Sarah because of the person or the alleged DV?**\n\nNeither, really. We were drawn to the *case* and to the unanswered questions. We reached out to several high-profile people. She answered first.\n\n**#37b: Do you believe Jorge was a victim of DV now that you’ve learned more about the case?**\n\nYes. And I always have.\n\n**#37c: Are you scarred from Sarah?**\n\nNo. Mainly because I didn’t misread the situation going in.\n\n**#37d: Will you change your approach with documentaries going forward because of your experience with Sarah?**\n\nIn every possible way. Especially the boundary-setting part. But I doubtr we will get that chance again.\n\n**#38: Did you feel like you had appease Sarah and go along with her narrative in order to keep access and get information, or did you truly believe that she wasn’t a murderer and acted in self-defense?**\n\nAbsolutely. That’s exactly what happened. The first one.\n\n**#39a-b: IF you know…why didn’t the defense call Brian Boone? They seem to have a plan for him and didn’t follow through…2. Who were some of the other witnesses they had on their witness list, and why were none of them called?**\n\nI don’t know either of those answers. I can say that Owens had 30 days to put together a murder defense. The State had years. I think he did the best he could with what he had.\n\n**#40: Did you ever hear her have any remorse for what she did, any at all? Did you ever encourage her to show some remorse?**\n\nNot once did she ever express remorse. I never encouraged it, I was preparing for the filmmaking team (researchers, filmmakers, directors, editors etc) to come in and do what they do best. I tried to not influence her as much as possible.  \n\n**#41: When you first saw the suitcase snuff film, what did you think?**\n\nThe same thing you probably did, with abject horror.\n\n**#42: Did you watch the trial, and were you surprised by Sarah‘s cold, often smirking arrogant demeanor on the stand?**\n\nNot really. Honestly, she did better than I expected.\n\n**#43: Did you ever question her on some of her lies and contradictions? The journal entry of the first time they met describes a almost cartoonishly horrific scene of abuse, but testifying on the stand under oath, she described a very pleasant introduction from a mutual friend, and “1 hour turned into four.“ Did you ever question her about these complete changes in her story?**\n\nWe never reached that phase. That would’ve been the director’s job once we had funding.\n\n**#44: How does Peter has so much patience talking to Sarah, I noticed when she gets angry, he talks in such a way to de escalate the conversation from spiraling. Does Nicole also dump her baggage on Peter when she has a bad day with Sarah??**\n\nI don’t know. Maybe it’s because I have 150 children (my animals) here on my farm and I’ve learned? Seriously, I think it was easy to be patient because this was a business relationship, not a friendship. As for Nicole - she is kind-hearted and we talked about her frustrations, but she rebounds quickly. She has her own reservoir of patience.\n\n**#45: Do they know the reason behind that lawyer withdrawing because Sarah asked them to do something that wasn’t ethical?**\n\nI am sorry, I don’t.\n\n**#46: What was the final straw?**\n\nRealizing she wasn’t going to participate in the documentary. It wasn’t the end of a friendship. It was the end of a business deal. For Julien, it was Sarah’s reaction to Lana’s death and also seeing the stress the online mess was causing Mary. But even way before that, he was done. Out of frustration, he began challenging her and she stopped calling him.\n\n(Name redacted) I hope this answers some of your community’s questions. If more come up, we’re happy to address them. And if you ever want to talk directly , you know where to find me.  Once I get some time I will engage directly on your thread and/or follow up. Thank you again for taking the time to reach out.\n\nPete",

    "title": "Should I Close the Comments Section on Two Vlogs",
    "selftext": "I've published hundreds of vlogs over more than a decade as a travel YouTuber (@madtraveler) and have NEVER ONCE considered not allowing comments until now. Over the summer, I was in Arkansas reporting on a magazine story and I filmed two vlogs which were pretty atypical for my channel. One was about visiting Harrison, Arkansas, which has been branded America's most racist town by some. In this vlog, I asked locals about whether the label was fair and I interviewed the leader of the KKK at the KKK compound. I also interviewed a guy who has widely been dubbed America's most racist man.\n\nIn the other vlog, I visited an all white community that excludes non-whites, jews, gays and other groups. Both of these vlogs had really great CTR and engagement, but when they came out, YouTube showed them to very few people. Perhaps because the algorithm wasn't sure if I was supporting these groups or not (clearly I am NOT). In any case, I just assumed they were dead videos. But more recently, these vlogs are being seen by people who are specifically searching for the name of this all white community and by those searching KKK and other related terms. \n\nThe result is that these vlogs are finding their way to racists. I have never had a vlog that was less than 90% liked but these two are hovering around 70-75%. Not only that I'm getting hostile, sometimes racist, comments on these vlogs, attacking me for asking them difficult questions and such on a daily basis. I'm deleting all of them but it is getting annoying to have to do so. In the case of the all white community, i have a feeling they've essentially also unleashed their fan club on me. Do I turn off the comments completely or just keep moderating? If you want to see the links to these to decide, let me know, although, as I said, I have already deleted the most egregious comments. Thanks for your input.  ",

They said that you need to be willing to go undercover and put on an act of being a racist in order to make other, actually racist people feel safe enough to reveal their racism to you, so that you can expose them for what they really are, and being too openly anti-racist to begin with will just make racists become better at hiding.

    "title": "Who would I vote for and why (Part II, 1864-1932)",
    "selftext": "\n1864:\n\nAbraham Lincoln 100%, the Civil War and the Emancipation Proclamation would’ve made him get my vote 100%, sure suspending Habeas Corpus was bad but I would support the war effort.\n\nGeorge McClellan was a chameleon, I would not forgive the Democrats that easily for what they did.\n\n1868:\n\nUlysses S Grant, Reconstruction was now full swing and the last 4 years have been horrible cause of Andrew Johnson’s Presidency and so the Democrats could’ve nominated the best candidate, I still would’ve gone for Ulysses S Grant. \n\nHoratio Seymour was a corrupt and a racist who ran on a pro KKK platform so an automatic no. \n\n1872:\n\nUlysses S Grant had a pretty good first term, and with some mistakes too but he still shared my views on big Government.\n\nI feel like there aren’t any words on how to describe Horace Greeley, like bad or weird or I don’t know, he wouldn’t be fit to be President.\n\n1876:\n\nOh boy, what an interesting election, well Reconstruction is almost over and Ulysses S Grant’s Presidency went quite well  with the recent Civil Rights Act of 1875 too but the Panic of 1873 sucks.\n\nI would not vote for Samuel J Tilden, he was a fervent racist, who would destroy any progress made on Civil Rights until that point.\n\nRutherford B Hayes was I think pretty good as Ohio Governor and a good person too with good policies, fought in the Civil War too so in the end, I would vote for him.\n\n1880:\n\nThe Compromise of 1877 certainly hurt the GOP and Rutherford B Hayes’ Presidency but it was average or above average.\n\nJames A Garfield would’ve had me energised, so good on Civil Rights, a good Congressman, good with his anti corruption platforms, big government dude also, he would’ve had my vote 100%.\n\nWinfield Scott Hancock is weird, I respect him for how he was with the Union during the Civil War but pretty racist I believe.\n\nI would not like how the GOP relies heavily during the election on shady people like Jame G  Blaine and Roscoe Conkling.\n\n1884:\n\nGrover Cleveland, the first Democrat I would vote for so far in fact, pretty bad and gross guy though but very good on anti corruption and while not on big government, he would be better by looking at his record before the election.\n\nJames G Blaine was bad and corrupt, a weak candidate too, unfit to carry forward the Republican Agenda left by the late James A Garfield and incumbent Chester A Arthur (who took office after the assassination).\n\n\n1888:\n\nThis would be very clear so…..I would go with Benjamin Harrison again, Grover Cleveland  had a meh first term and doesn’t align with my views but had some accomplishment particularly with Civil Service Reform it would be close as the Dawes Act of 1887 was horrible but also:\n\nBenjamin Harrison was a really good guy, Civil War vet and the only major campaign issue really was about tariffs, he was pro tariffs, Cleveland was against tariffs, I do agree there need to be some tariffs, also Benjamin Harrison was pro big government, like me, pro Civil War pensions like me, pro Civil Rights, like me, so yeah, the issue I’d have with him would be on Native Americans.\n\n1892:\n\nI’d be tired this election, tired of Benjamin Harrison, who had a bad Presidency unfortunately and also tired of the prospect of returning to the “meh-ness” of Grover Cleveland.\n\nBenjamin Harrison went too far with tariffs for my liking, with the McKinley tariff, plus he awarded the ones at Wounded Knee, plus his economic plans being not good.\n\nSo I would vote for a breath of fresh air…..James B Weaver, populist candidate of the People’s Party, not that great on native and economic policies but neither were the other two, he was great on Civil Rights and Labor and the country really needed someone to stand up for them.\n\n1896:\nThis would be very close for me as the country was now in the Panic of 1893 and Grover Cleveland had a bad second term and the Democrats were in a horrible place.\n\nWilliam McKinley was all about tarrifs, like how Benjamin Harrison was 8 years earlier, but he was the arhitect of the horrible McKinley tariff which lead to the Panic of 1893, good guy though with not bad policies and the country definitely needed  something away from the Democrats but then you have:\n\nWilliam Jennings Bryan, the populist candidate of the Democratic Party who put up a good fight, anti corruption, anti imperialism, very good person too.\n\nVery close, extremely close for me, I think in the end….I will go with William McKinley, the sickness at the Democratic Party I would’ve had at the time would’ve made me give the boost to William McKinley and his free silver stance would’ve been off but I guess both stances were not amazing, same with the gold one.\n\n1900:\n\nThis one is way clearer to me, so:\n\nThe economy did get better from 1896, William McKinley had a pretty good first term, the Spanish American War went extremely well so kudos to the McKinley Administration, but there are some problems with his Presidency like on Civil Rights and on Imperialism as the horrible Philippine American War was going on at the time.\n\nSo I would vote for William Jennings Bryan, who still as if not more populist than four years ago, now abandoned his free silver rhetoric  and is now 100% full of Progressive ideas, shame his stances on some things like Civil Rights and Native Americans weren’t good, neither were William McKinley’s.\n\n1904:\n\nWilliam McKinley had a good 6 months of his second term before a wacko killed him and then Theodore Roosevelt came and had one of the greatest Presidencies so far (with some notable mistakes though like using concentration camps in the Philippines) so he would’ve 100% gotten my vote as he also shared my views (not the racist ones he had).\n\nAlton Parker was there.\n\n1908:\n\nWilliam Howard Taft was Theodore Roosevelt’s hand picked successor so I’d vote for him, right? Well no, he was very different from Theodore Roosevelt policy wise  and as Sec of War he was meh plus the horrible stuff he did in the Philippines.\n\nWilliam Jennings Bryan with his Progressive policies is back (most of which were influencing Theodore Roosevelt), so I’d find it logical to have the Progressive succeed another Progressive, he gets my vote.   \n\n1912:\n\nWhat a mess, despite having an actually good-ish Presidency, William Howard Taft could not keep his party together and was challenged by his much better successor, Theodore Roosevelt.\n\nWhen losing the GOP nomination, Theodore Roosevelt formed the progressive Bull Moose Party  so I’d in the end vote for him.\n\nWilliam Howard Taft was how Winfield Scott was 56 years ago, a captain of a sinking ship, he was politically dead, not that I’d vote for him anyways.\n\nDespite being William Jennings Bryan’s protege, I would find Woodrow Wilson weird, he did have pro labor and pro anti corruption policies but was very racist  (like I think every other candidate in this election unfortunately) and not really standing up to that Progressivism, he lacked the charisma.\n\nI dislike socialism= I dislike Eugene V Debs.\n\n1916:\n\nWorld War I is a mess but thankfully President Wilson kept the nation out of war, but along with his racist policies and other foreign policy messes, I don’t think I would vote for him.\n\nWho would’ve gotten my vote? Charles Evans Hughes, he was a compromise between the Progressive and the Conservative sides of the GOP.\n\n1920:\n\nWell look at that, Woodrow Wilson didn’t keep his promise at least we won the war but for this, plus for the Red Summer of 1919, I am tired of the Democrats for a while.\n\nBut, surprisingly, it would not that clear for me:\n\nTo start off, Warren G Harding was someone that seems to me not fit to be President, there’s something about that dude, I don’t know why, hope he’s not a bad person or shady but he’s running on a return to normalcy (is that even a word in 1920?), and that seems appealing.\n\nOn the other hand, there’s James M Cox, Progressive Governor of Ohio, but supported Woodrow Wilson and his policies so that’s a no for me.\n\nIn the end, I think I will go with Warren G Harding.\n\nFDR is an interesting running mate, Calvin Coolidge was kinda cool too.\n\n1924:\n\nWarren G Harding had a bad Presidency particularly with the Teapot Dome Scandal and died in 1923 so now Calvin Coolidge is President.\n\nCalvin Coolidge would be hurt by him being extremely small government and me not, he had a good enough record before the Presidency but his laissez faire economics would be horrible.\n\nJohn W Davis was there, and he was basically the same.\n\nThis is why, as a breath of fresh air, I would vote for Robert M LaFollete, the candidate from the Progressive Party,  with progressive ideas an offering a new, better perspective from the other two.\n\n1928:\n\nThis would be a weird election.\n\nCalvin Coolidge had an above average Presidency so that’s not bad.\n\nHerbert Hoover was kinda Progressive, only kinda, he was though a very good guy, big humanitarian, only big problem I’d have with him is his laissez faire economics.\n\nAl Smith, also kinda Progressive, way more than Herbert Hoover but not 100% but not with laissez faire economics, also a small government dude.\n\nDang, this would be extremely close, think I’d go with Al Smith in the end though.\n\n1932:\n\nHerbert Hoover had a horrible Presidency, not knowing how to handle the Great Depression, he failed as a President unfortunately.\n\nI’m 100% voting for Franklin D Roosevelt, the extremely Progressive Governor of New York.\n\nIf the GOP failed miserably at handling the Depression, then step aside and let the Dems do it. \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "selftext": "Madani is quick to say:\n\n* “Don’t call it jihad.”\n\nBut he is silent on:\n\n* “What do we call crimes done by Muslims inspired by radical ideology?”\n* “How does the community confront internal extremism?”\n* “What religious language will they use to delegitimize such acts?”\n\nYou cannot demand linguistic respect **without providing alternative moral clarity**.  \n  \n['Jihad Made Synonym Of Abuse': Madani Slams Govt, Media; Questions Judicial Independence](https://www.msn.com/en-in/politics/government/jihad-made-synonym-of-abuse-madani-slams-govt-media-questions-judicial-independence/ar-AA1RnY5d?ocid=BingNewsSerp)\n\n&gt;Jamiat Ulama-i-Hind president Maulana Mahmood Madani has criticised what he described as growing attempts to portray the term “jihad” as a symbol of violence and wrongdoing.\n\nRecently, ministers are calling any type of criminal activity as a 'Jihad'. There is 'paper leak jihad', 'train jihad', etc. These are criminal acts at the end of the day. Atleast Maulana acknoweldges (only indirectly and implied) that muslims from their community indulging in such acts is when Jihad is used. As observed, when hindu male commits rape on hindu female, then it's not called Jihad. Only when it's a muslim male and a hindu female, that term is used. \n\nTherefore, Maulana needs to clearly express and not leave anything at implicit judgment which exposes the elephant in the room that Madani will not address - Certain categories of crime have been ideologically motivated within parts of the Muslim community - whether small, fringe, or radicalized. Whether it’s:\n\n* train sabotage\n* ISIS-inspired lone wolf plans\n* Tablighi radical recruits\n* organised grooming networks in some regions\n* individuals drawing violence from Quranic misinterpretations\n\n…these *do exist*.   \n  \nMadani ignores that some crimes are committed with religious justification, even if by a minority of Muslims. But then what is their internal vocabulary for describing those who carry out such above-mentioned attacks. \n\nSo while Maulana may be making a point here, he also needs to be asked why is it that Muslims alone are specifically indulging in let's say love-jihad, or train jihad. Or if Jihad word itself needs to be dropped, perhaps as a way of respecting their religious sentiments, then Maulana must be asked, how would he himself term the acts of such citizens when they are muslims and radicalized to sabotage train tracks or carry out red fort blast or plan ricin attacks. Do they term them as shaheed, gazi, or what else? If they can't accept our world view and tell us to refrain from calling Islamist crimes as Jihad, then what would he call them as per his world view? If Madani wants the majority community to **not misuse the term “jihad”**, then he also has a corresponding responsibility: To explain what he calls such crimes within his own religious framework. Is it fasad (corruption/violence), baghawat (rebellion), hirabah (terror), fitnah (destructive discord), khawarij (extremist deviants)\n\n**The real issue: asymmetry between “offence taken” and “accountability offered”**\n\nMadani also said**: “Isliye jab jab zulm hoga tab tab jihad hoga,”**. Really, then he needs to provide moral clarity of 'what's a zulm'. Does he call destruction of illegal houses and encroachment as 'zulm'? If not then he needs to tell his muslim brotherhood that they got to function in accordance with local municipal norms and zoning restrictions. They cannot do just anything freely as they desire. India is not their Auqaf (Waqf Property). But pray how is he gonna do that when he already told them that the Constitution of Allah is higher than the Constitution of India. Why would they respect any law in India, which derives its sustenance from the Constitution of India.",

    "selftext": "The Trump administration will collect data on crimes and human rights abuses committed by migrants to Australia as part of its global drive to combat mass migration, which it describes as “an existential threat to Western civilisation”.\n\nThe intervention into domestic affairs goes beyond illegal immigration and seeks to caution Canberra that a significant intake of migrants, “particularly of a culture that’s radically different from Australia’s”, can lead to political and economic instability.\n\nThe senior State Department official, who spoke on condition of not being named, said the US government was concerned a large influx of migrants could strain markets, naming Australia’s housing crisis as an example.\n\n“Beyond that, we want to caution the Australians,” he told this masthead. “We love the Australian people … We just want to warn our friends that if you import a rapid number of individuals of any background, particularly of a culture that’s radically different from Australia’s, without any sort of mechanism for diffusing the impact, that can lead to political unrest, that can lead to economic instability.”\n\nThe senior State Department official, who spoke on condition of not being named, said the US government was concerned a large influx of migrants could strain markets, naming Australia’s housing crisis as an example.\n\n“Beyond that, we want to caution the Australians,” he told this masthead. “We love the Australian people … We just want to warn our friends that if you import a rapid number of individuals of any background, particularly of a culture that’s radically different from Australia’s, without any sort of mechanism for diffusing the impact, that can lead to political unrest, that can lead to economic instability.”\n\nThe official said that while illegal immigration was “the elephant in the room”, the Trump administration was concerned about mass migration more broadly.\n\n“You have to have some common sense about that,” he told this masthead. “You also have to understand the limitations ... and the security concerns that come with mass migration, and what happens when you import a substantial number of people into a very tight, particular area.”\n\nA spokesperson for the Australian government said the Trump administration had not raised the matter with Australia.\n\n“Australia is a pluralist nation, we welcome different races, religions and views, united by respect for each other’s humanity and for each other’s right to live in peace,” the spokesperson said.\n\nAustralia admits 185,000 permanent migrants a year, mostly skilled workers. Net overseas migration, which includes temporary workers, international students and visitors, is falling rapidly from a post-COVID high of 538,000 in 2022-23. It has now dropped to about 316,000, lower than forecast.\n\nBut Opposition Leader Sussan Ley has pledged to unveil a policy that would further cut the intake, amid a hot-button debate over immigration and population.\n\nIn a separate cable, the State Department also instructed embassies to begin collating its next annual human rights report, traditionally one of the most comprehensive studies of human rights abuses around the world.\n\nThe Trump administration is changing the focus of the report to scrutinise countries’ enforcement of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) policies, as well as government funding for abortion services and gender transition surgery for children.\n\nThe senior State Department official, on a briefing call to news media, said the administration was not afraid to call out its allies “just as much as we’re willing to call out our enemies”.\n\nIt was also determined to address human rights concerns that have been ignored by the global human rights community “because they were politically incorrect, or they weren’t convenient to the prevailing narratives”.\n\nThe official said the fact that the mass migration project was being managed by the department’s Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labour indicated how seriously the administration was taking the issue.\n\n“This is a real problem. There are security implications to this. There are cultural implications to this. There are economic implications to this,” he said. “We think it’s about time that for the sake of our allies, for the sake of their citizens, for the sake of our friends, someone said something about this.”\n\nThe latest intervention continues a global project articulated by Vice President JD Vance when he spoke at the Munich Security Conference in February, warning European leaders their voters were rebelling against “out-of-control migration”, and that politicians ignored the will of the people at their peril.\n\nUS President Donald Trump dramatically pressed the case when he told the United Nations in September that “the globalist migration agenda”, along with environmental and economic policies to combat climate change, were destroying Western societies. “Your countries are going to hell,” he said.\n\nA senior policy adviser at the State Department’s Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labour, Samuel Samson, graduated from university in 2021. In May, he posted an essay on the department’s Substack shaming Europe for its “democratic backsliding”, facilitation of mass migration and descriptions of certain right-wing political parties as extremists.\n\n“The global liberal project is not enabling the flourishing of democracy,” he wrote. “Rather, it is trampling democracy, and Western heritage along with it, in the name of a decadent governing class afraid of its own people … Achieving peace in Europe and around the world requires not a rejection of our shared cultural heritage, but a renewal of it.”",

    "selftext": "I'd like to understand something, if possible. It's all just theory, but it makes sense to me. \n\nThis conflict between Israel and Palestine is impossible to resolve because the land is so tiny, and two peoples who deeply hate each other cannot live on it. It's not like India and Pakistan, where the territory was very large and both peoples were able to live on their lands after forced emigration from both sides. \n\nIsrael opposes a Palestinian state because they see them only as Arabs, and Arabs already have many countries. Israel has fought three or four wars with Arab countries and knows they are larger and have more resources. Without the West Bank, Israel would be even smaller and could easily be divided in two and destroyed. Literally the dream of Palestinian extremists. That's why the majority, even those who are non-religious, supports the control of the West Bank.\n\nOn the other hand, Palestinians see themselves as the legitimate owners of the land. For them, Jews are Europeans, and their religious connection to the territory doesn't matter, they lived in that land for centuries as a majortity, jews might have lived there 2000 ago but they dont care. Its like indigenous people of Americas, Americans wouldn't like millions of indigenous people from Mexico, Canada, and Colombia arriving in their territory and trying to recreate a country for themselves.\n\nIn the Arab view the Middle Eastern minorities will always be seen as minorities and shouldn't have states; the Druze and Kurds are an example of what Jews should be in the Palestinian view. Of course, most Palestinians want a state so they don't have to live under Israeli control, without checkpoints, without an unfair justice system, without prohibition of entry into and exit from West Bank cities itself, a life with dignity.\n\nNow comes the fanciful part of my comment: what if its possible to create an articial Island south of Cyprus near Israel with about 20,000 square kilometers of habitable land? And hand that island over to Israel? Theoretically, they wouldn't need the West Bank anymore because if they had \"geographic depth,\" they wouldn't have to fear a Palestinian state or an Arabs states unite to attack them. I mean, the majority in Israel is non-religious, they are secular. They could give up the West Bank, but they don't because they need \"geographic depth.\" If such project were possible, could peace between the two peoples be achieved?\n\nIt's a silly question, but I don't know where to ask it, I don't want to offend anyone.",

    "selftext": "# Johannes Volkmann, 28, up-and-coming lawmaker and scion of the longtime chancellor, urges tougher laws against Jew-hatred, warning fear has ‘become normalized’ for German Jews\n\n[Johannes Volkmann in the Reichstag building, the seat of the German Bundestag. \\(Tobias Koch\\)](https://preview.redd.it/xecmxmh3u54g1.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b705ac4393c542dbecd453ad1aabfe45c40cc055)\n\nJohannes Volkmann, an up-and-coming young conservative German lawmaker with a prominent political pedigree, says he is embarrassed by what he calls many Germans’ acceptance of surging antisemitism since Hamas’s October 7, 2023, attack on Israel, which has led his country’s Jews to “exist only in fear.”\n\nVolkmann, 28, is one of the youngest lawmakers in the Christian Democratic Union, the party once led by his grandfather, former longtime German Chancellor and pro-Israel stalwart Helmut Kohl.\n\n“I’m ashamed of how willingly large parts of our society, especially supposedly progressive circles, have tolerated this development,” Volkmann told The Times of Israel last week.\n\n“Eighty years after the Shoah, we have learned that what should be self-evident in Germany is not, that Jewish life in our cities must be possible without fear,” he said. Instead, “it has become normalized that visible Jewish life in many places can exist only in fear or under police protection.”\n\nThe remarks come amid a dramatic spike in antisemitic incidents in Germany. The Research and Information Center on Antisemitism, an independent watchdog known by the acronym RIAS, documented 8,627 incidents in 2024, a 77 percent rise from the previous year, including eight instances of extreme antisemitic violence, such as attacks resulting in physical injury, and another 186 physical assaults.\n\nBetween 2022 and 2023, according to police data, the number of antisemitic crimes doubled, with a spike following the Hamas-led October 7 attack. Between 2023 and last year, the number rose by another 20%, with a total of 6,236 cases recorded in 2024.\n\n[German Chancellor Helmut Kohl in Hamburg, 1973. \\(Bundesarchiv, B 145 Bild-F041436-0027 \\/ Engelbert Reineke \\/ CC-BY-SA\\)](https://preview.redd.it/fyi2g0o7u54g1.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3da85ec032103f375d4eab02fa11738803d7ee4a)\n\nVolkmann is calling for a far more forceful government response. That includes tighter immigration policies and residency rules, enhanced disciplinary powers for universities, and laws against providing arts funding to antisemitic endeavors.\n\n“We have a duty to confront antisemitism in our cultural landscape, at universities, and particularly in some migrant communities,” he said.\n\nVolkmann, one of the youngest lawmakers in the CDU, has quickly risen within the party once led by his grandfather, which has governed Germany for most of its postwar history. He became active in the Christian Democrats while still in school and joined the party’s federal board in 2024 at age 27, making him its youngest member.\n\nEarlier this year, he entered the Bundestag and joined the CDU’s “Young Group,” considered an influential force within the parliamentary faction. He has also been a frequent guest on German talk shows and has become one of the more visible faces of the party’s younger generation.\n\nIn that role, he hasn’t shied away from speaking out when it comes to antisemitism in Germany. He drew attention earlier this year by accusing the left-wing Die Linke party of promoting antisemitism and downplaying Islamist terror.\n\nIn August, he visited an anti-Israel tent protest in Frankfurt, and attempted to engage demonstrators in debate on camera.\n\n[Supporters of the far-right AfD party sing the national anthem as they attend an election campaign rally of the party for the upcoming state elections in Suhl, Germany, August 13, 2024. \\(AP Photo\\/Markus Schreiber, File\\)](https://preview.redd.it/li4pv8iau54g1.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5530d6af503446c6151852bb03fefbe028ac5b85)\n\nBut he made clear that rising antisemitism is a danger on the far-right as well as the left. He said he rejects praise for the far-right Alternative for Germany, or AfD, which has surged in popularity in recent years, even though that party has also raised the alarm about migrants in the country.\n\n“In my personal environment, I frequently hear statements that see the AfD as a beacon of hope out of concern about migrant and Islamist antisemitism,” he said. “I can only warn against this. There are strong völkisch \\[German ethno-nationalist\\] elements in the AfD that at least show openness to traditional right-wing extremist antisemitism and freely use corresponding linguistic codes.”\n\nHe also said that the left-wing German party, Die Linke, tolerates “structural Israel-related antisemitism within its own ranks.” He pointed to harsh criticism of Israel from its members, including a spokesperson for the party’s youth organization, who [said](https://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article69085aa5df9fa029228f1690/linke-parteijugend-antisemitischer-beschluss-wie-sich-die-linksjugend-endgueltig-dem-israel-hass-verschreibt.html) of the war in Gaza, “This is a genocide. This is a fucking Holocaust. This is the Holocaust!”\n\nHe said such “currents” are ones that “move outside the boundaries of our liberal-democratic basic order.” He added, “A party that tolerates such things is a political opponent for me and not a cooperative competitor.”\n\n[Top candidates of the left-wing Die Linke \\(The Left\\) party, Jan van Aken \\(L\\) and Heidi Reichinnek \\(R\\), together with the co-leader of Germany’s Die Linke party Ines Schwerdtner \\(C\\) pose as they arrive to address a press conference in Berlin, on February 24, 2025, one day after the German federal elections. \\(John MACDOUGALL \\/ AFP\\)](https://preview.redd.it/cssv2qrdu54g1.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=475b8cf9654e1d16549f239fcad34efcaac4cda1)\n\nVolkmann has argued that Germany must be more willing to deport non-citizens who commit antisemitic offenses online or at demonstrations.\n\n“Immigration law also serves to protect public safety,” he said, suggesting that he would like to change laws so that courts can allow more deportations than they do at present.\n\nHe also proposed changes to higher education laws to allow the expulsion of students who harass Jewish classmates or participate in violent campus occupations.\n\nAnd he said government arts funding policies should explicitly hew to the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) [working definition of antisemitism](https://holocaustremembrance.com/resources/working-definition-antisemitism), which includes certain types of anti-Israel rhetoric among its examples, such as calling the country a “racist endeavor.”\n\nMany German artistic projects receive government support; Volkmann would like to see those that run afoul of the IHRA definition lose their public funding.\n\n“A large part of the electorate rightly expects that we do not subsidize Israel-related antisemitism with German taxpayers’ money,” he said.\n\n[This file photo taken on September 22, 1984, in Douamont, near Verdun, shows French President Francois Mitterrand \\(L\\) and German Chancellor Helmut Kohl holding hands as they listen to French and German National anthems during the reconciliation ceremony in tribute to French and German soldiers killed during the First and Second World Wars. \\/ AFP PHOTO \\/ MARCEL MOCHET](https://preview.redd.it/0wgwxkwfu54g1.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eae1a6646430c2da2cf74e6168a35d5f78748a0d)\n\nVolkmann is generally reserved when it comes to public statements about his grandfather, but Kohl — who served as German chancellor from 1982 to 1998 and oversaw the country’s reunification — was also known for his friendship with Jews and Israel.\n\nUnder his leadership, German-Israeli relations grew closer. Avi Primor, Israel’s ambassador to Berlin from 1993 to 1999, said in a 2017 interview with a radio station affiliated with Deutsche Welle that Kohl greatly valued Israel and saw it as “a blessing for Germany in science and research.” Primor added that a personal friendship grew between Kohl and then-prime minister Yitzhak Rabin, before Rabin’s 1995 assassination.\n\nAs chancellor, Kohl also allowed the immigration of about 200,000 Jews from the former Soviet Union. As a result, the official membership of German Jewish communities grew from around 30,000 in 1990 to more than 100,000 at the beginning of the 2000s. Since then, the number has slightly declined to around 90,000. In total, estimates suggest that today roughly 200,000 Jews live in Germany, compared to over 500,000 before the Holocaust.\n\nLast year, especially citing his grandfather’s commitment to a united Europe, Volkmann told the newspaper Zeit, “Many of his political values are more important today than at any time since the end of the Cold War.”\n\n[Helmut Kohl's politician grandson is ‘ashamed’ of Germany's response to antisemitism | The Times of Israel](https://www.timesofisrael.com/helmut-kohls-politician-grandson-is-ashamed-of-germanys-response-to-antisemitism/)",

    "selftext": "\\[part 2. [Here is part 1.](https://www.reddit.com/user/hyeran_jainros_fc/comments/1p9bdk8/stans_bullied_kpop_demon_hunters_creator_maggie/)\\]\n\n# -Sports: tribal yet less fanwars than Kpop/politics. Objectivity of scores?\n\n**Sports rivalries tap into the tribal instinct, generally in a more healthy way than how Kpop stans seem to interact.** Both are fan driven but so different. At least modern sports, not the gladiators of ancient Rome’s bread and circuses era. You don’t need real violence when there’s MSG in Takis and endless, personalized entertainment on a portable HD screen. Bread and circuses could never 🤤\n\nThere was the English soccer players barraged by racist emoji in 2021. Supporters actually responded [by drowning out the insults with supportive comments](https://www.vox.com/recode/2021/7/14/22577682/marcus-rashford-sancho-bukayo-saka-england-facebook-instagram-social-media-racism-england-twitter). But I think racism is more political; otherwise, you rarely hear an athlete bullied in this way. It’s partly the established cultural norms for sports. It’s more frequently an in person experience where norms are reinforced. Widespread coverage does the same. Kpop is newer, more online, and isn’t the subject of established TV coverage that sports have. It happens, but it’s abnormal, frowned upon, or illegal to get too excited and do things like throw stuff at athletes you dislike or riot when celebrating a win. \n\nMeanwhile, **the score in sports is pretty objective.** The emphasis is on specific technical feats rather than personality and fandom. There’s also the custom of supporting your local team, not just the best team, which limits overexcitement. \n\nBoth politics and Kpop excite the imagination in more subjective ways. **The subjectivity of accomplishments is partly how stans get carried away with the greatness of their fav.** If the success/greatness is hard to objectively measure, then it’s easier to have no limit for how great you think they are. Few political stans could walk you through how their fav’s policies are effective. **How many would ride or die support them 10 years later?** Kpop stans are so hyper fixated on their fav’s superiority, which can be hard to measure. Is this why they need to compare and belittle perceived threats? They act like there’s some direct, zero sum struggle when their group has no overt position on hating another group. **This imaginary competition seems to come from how social media has hacked our tribalism more than from Kpop itself.**\n\nThere’s also a shared parasocial element built on how politics and Kpop both sell personalities.\n\n# -Tech push and pulls us into a unique cognitive dissonance:\n\n* Silicon Valley succeeds through better serving our craving for **instant gratification**. This isn’t inherently bad, but **it’s addictive and conditions us to feel entitled**. It’s a surface level ‘empowerment’ that doesn’t increase some overall level of gratification. Think of the absurd outrage against Netflix for penalizing password sharing. \n* **More interaction, yet more detachment.** Abundant interaction with strangers is not something our brains evolved for, yet we lived in cities for thousands of years. The smartphone takes this further, where people are reduced to text. China is called a ‘cashless society’ because of digital payments largely replaced cash. **Interacting with people online is a faceless society.** This apparent ease of interaction without the real thing can make us crave it even more. \n* Joining a Kpop fandom can give a similar, illusory sense of belonging. \n* A toxic Kpop stan seems to have one more drug in the compound addiction. Social media &gt; smartphone &gt; their fav Kpop idols. The **addiction aspect of tech is ultimately disempowering.**\n* Kpop itself seems built to be more stimulating, more multi-sensory dopamine hits than expression. A lot of the appeal is the ‘parasocial’ element. Hi touch, special app messaging, variety content that makes the idol seem accessible. That gives the illusion of some special connection to fans. The toxic bashing seems like a side effect of overstimulated, lonely imaginations. “Jennie/Soyeon/etc would love this.” 💭\n* **The negative and vulgar gets more attention**, something social media has intensified. Paying attention to the negative taught our ancestors about danger. It’s survival adaptations exploited by companies.  A lot like our desire for sweet food isn’t a problem when it compelled our early humans to eat rare and nutritious fruits. Viral negativity that we’ve seen before is a subliminal conditioning that enables these insults against Maggie.\n* Under the guise of free speech or empowerment, **there’s no social cost (shame) for online misbehavior**. We’re all conditioned by that ‘power’ to leave a 1 star review, etc. Nobody thinks they have to be careful what they ‘tweet,’ which intentionally sounds less formal than ‘write’ or ‘say.’ (Less friction, the character limit rewards short attention.) The frame that we approach online comments is less considered than face to face discussion. These stans would be more hesistant saying these things to Maggie’s face, even if Jennie were there. \n\nThis leads to the core internal tension: **a dissonance between feeling empowered and disempowered.** ‘Belonging,’ yet not. It lowers the barriers to being negative when you have no fear of being judged and feel entitled to insult people because it’s so normal online. Or you see other people rush to defend your fav and think you should do the same. **It’s a kind of groupthink that’s like an amplified version of the bystander effect.** That’s a psychological phenomenon where being around more people makes you not want to help a distressed victim. Online the even higher level of anonymity makes you actively want to hurt someone. I also feel like **there’s some bystander effect in the companies involved, where even if they’re aware Maggie is getting harassed on X they just ignore it.** Like it’s “not my job.”\n\n**Feeling a sense of belonging via fighting for the same ‘cause.’** These stans could feel they ‘won’ by silencing Maggie, which may be the most real ‘power’ they experienced. Ridiculously, it validates their own thinking.\n\nKpop idol worship can have this paranoid, hyperactive sense of indignation. It’s their version of political consipiracies or religious crusading. **Groupthink that leads stans to believe anything other than praise is an insult to their fav.** The stans attacking Maggie reflexively think she’s being “shady,” a judgment that might come from of watching entertainment online more than real life social intelligence.\n\n# -Triggered is just better engagement: copy paste extremism\n\nI think **our evolved responses violence and gossip are activated by online paranoia.** It’s a vicious cycle from social media’s training to display engaging content. Algorithms don’t care about ‘good’ or ‘mentally healthy.’ Even if it filters negativity that’s overtly against terms of service, it’s still biased toward the simplistic content that provokes engagement. \n\n**Extremism fuels extremism, much like violence.** \n\nFirst, people see others they disagree with and the need to defend themselves. Insulting language doesn’t rise to the level of ‘violence,’ but it is an ‘escalation of force.’ People in violent environments learn violence partly as a survival mechanism, again going back to before our species.  You have to be violent for protection. Maybe extremism activates a similar response.\n\nSecond, people see an escalation of force and feel they should follow these people who believe in the same cause. **They learn through example something that was once forbidden.** It’s like 9/11 and the subsequent rise in suicide attacks by Al Qaeda and Iraqi insurgents. They were very uncommon among Islamist radicals before 9/11. Or the rise in mass shootings in the US. These are events that are spread by the media and then imitated, because humans learn through observing others. ‘Mirror neurons’ activate when we see someone else performing a behavior. Brain activity is much as if we’re performing the behavior ourselves. (I’m not an expert and don’t know how far this goes. But I read that even if action is somewhat removed from an observable behavior, such as hearing music, mirror neurons are triggered.) Both suicide attacks and mass shootings are violence intended to be a media event.\n\n**Notice how this is similar to dangerous online challenges.** The thrill of vanity makes us reckless and tactless. Other people doing it = it’s ok, especially the more you see it. The scale of these platforms compound when they make participating so effortless. After billions of interactions and exposures, what was rare becomes more common if it’s stimulating/engaging. **Repeat messaging becomes a kind of propaganda where you’re known to be interested in the message.** It’s not the old, obsolete totalitarianism that obsolete teachers focus on. The platform will say whatever you want to hear to make you stay.\n\nFor stans, maybe it’s a combination of feeling defensive when they see someone attacking their idols, and mirroring stan behavior. Facebook started with grouping people into what calls ‘lookalike audiences’ for content/ad purposes. A group of people that will respond in a similar way. This moved from predicting behavior to directing it, if unintentionally. **Showing engaging content resulted in the illusion that Kpop/politics is more combative and threatening than it actually is.** This is what ‘triggers’ an aggressive response. That’s why I think there’s so much potential for a Kpop campaign that lets fans know that there’s nothing to be paranoid about. \n\nI don’t think ‘stan’ is the right word, because it encompasses innocent fans. These are Kpop extremists 😂.\n\n# -Disengage for a day\n\nThere should be legal or cultural change, and I hope the addiction lawsuits win something.\n\nAs big as tech is, I don’t think it’s impossible to hurt them or take back some of what they’ve taken. Stock valuations depend on incremental growth. Missing earnings expectations by just a small amount could cause a drop by tens of billions of dollars. It seems hard to abandon social media. But I hope one day it’s seen like how it was hard for a smoking society to quit in the past.\n\nAll the tribalism of social media is ironically distracting. There is a tribe that’s dominating resources that feel increasingly scarce. **Money, political power, electricity, water: it’s going to big tech. They’re the one tribe that’s unquestionably winning.**\n\nA lot of people dislike gen AI. Most aren’t really aware of its level of electricity and water use, the other reason to push back against big tech. Taking some kind of coordinated break. Call it disengagement, no tap, 1 day 1 billion, whatever. You don’t have to give it up completely, but if a lot of us cut back just one day, tech would pay attention. There’s a reason religions and the same Western society that birthed capitalism also have a weekend.\n\nThis is a whole bigger issue than Kpop. But I think the way Kpop fans are radicalized by social media is so much like how online politics has gotten more dysfunctional. Despite the absence of some radical Kpop ideology. **It gets toxic because social media intoxicates.** The problem is our dependency on these platforms.\n___\n\n# This can only happen on X. Do we try to get Elon Musk’s attention?\n\nAfter accidentally buying X, he found more use in it as an engaging marketing tool for himself than as a direct moneymaker. Per estimates, it's business is declining largely because of Musk’s lax moderation. **This cost is a price he’s willing to pay for a sort of ‘competitive advantage.’** Greater ‘freedom of speech’ to insult is now part of X’s appeal. The extremists bashing Maggie have no other place to tell her how they really feel. Yet Musk didn’t initially know how unpopular his approach would be. He hoped it would help Twitter grow, not stagnate even more. \n\nMaybe this leads to an angle to direct Musk’s attention to Maggie: cleaning it up could appeal to advertisers. Not just banning or suspending those anti fans. But **changing X so it doesn’t allow users to virally harass someone off the app.** The two relevant posts seem to have the most comments, over 200 each. \n\nAlso, Twitter is a smaller platform where collectively not using it would hurt more.\n___\n\n# Kpop stans: cult without a leader\n\nWhat’s different with Kpop stans is this ‘cult without a leader’ dynamic. Again, it’s not like a rap beef where a rapper is overtly attacking someone. Idols rarely ever say anything negative because their image is so controlled by the company. Nobody is calling for Kpop attacks besides random stans. ‘Random’ because it’s not the same opinion leaders each time, the way we have influencers with politics. Whatever toxic meme takes hold originates from new people each time, and following their opinion doesn’t give that person a lasting following. We usually don’t know who starts a hate campaign. \n\n**Kpop taps into our tribalism, as do cults, which have probably lost market share to social media.** We identify as Once, Blink, etc—an effective marketing tool. Companies learned to pick the name for us, to group us together, make us feel part of the idols’ cause. Other musicians and products rarely do this. [Marketing based on cult psychology](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cult-brand.asp) is a thing. Some of it doesn’t intentionally replicate cults, but happen to appeal in the same way, like the classic ‘cult brand’ examples of Apple, Starbucks, Tesla. Others have studied these brands and cults to deliberately copy their practices. Lululemon might be one. \n\nKpop has a more direct and comprehensive way to target the mind. It gives us choreographed multisensory pleasure hits. Reverse *engineering* appealing girl and boy groups. This is per [The Verge’s coverage of SM founder’s Culture Technology approach](https://www.theverge.com/2012/10/18/3516562/k-pop-invades-america-south-korea-pop-music-factory), which defined the industry. This idea of Kpop is very ‘manufactured,’ as much as some object to that label. ‘Engineered’ might be a better description. The approach is purely commercial, such as SM’s innovation to include local country idols as a way to market to that country. (This idea still drives the industry, from Blackpink to Katseye.) One of the targeted ‘senses’ is of course that ‘parasocial’ bond that makes the sounds and MVs come alive. Hence the fantasy purity element with idol restrictions on dating. \n\nThe grueling discipline of idols, giving up so much of what is human, has a coincidental parallel to Jesus sacrificing for humanity’s sins in Christianity. I don’t know if the industry directly imitated cult psychology. But **the choice of the English word ‘idol,’ which seemed so innocuous at first, is very telling.** No other product has such a direct invitation for you to worship it.\n\nI think **there is a kind of reality distortion among Kpop fans that feels cult like.** On one hand there’s a reality distortion force field that negates all idol mistakes. It goes in the opposite, witch hunt direction with excessive hostility toward idols’ appearance, private lives, or image. Like the uproar and nosiness typically following Kpop dating rumors.\n\nThe toxic enemy bashing like what happened to Maggie is peak parasocial: purely guessing the thoughts of an idol, and acting on it because you like them so much you think you know them. There’s this odd element of conformity, yet nobody is actually issuing orders. It's like a peer pressure to be seen as loyal enough of a ‘soldier.’ **It’s a desperation to fight for your fav, when they don’t even want you to fight.**\n\n**I wonder how much overlap there is between toxic stans and the high spending superfans that Kpop relies on.** Rolling Stone’s recent article on KDH quotes a “high-ranking Kpop executive”\n\n&gt;I haven’t spoken to a label that’s not trying to get involved \\[with KDH\\] in some way,\n\n**So if Maggie had owned some music rights, she might have bargaining power with Kpop and its fandom.** From what I read Republic/Visva Records and Sony have those rights. \n\nI hope she’s strong enough to find a way to satirize this in the sequel or in other work, how fan wars get so rabid. In the past few weeks we had Soyeon stans go racist and rabid on Yseult in that MV plagiarism scandal. Of course, Soyeon herself said nothing. Even if her company limits what she can speak about, this suggests she’s probably nowhere as defensive about perceived slights as toxic stans.\n\nIt makes you think of the potential **if an active Kpop star with a rabid following actually asked them to do something bad. Could be an interesting Kdrama.** Or maybe it would just be like Nicki Minaj encouraging fans to bash perceived rivals, where a petty need to win every battle ends up hurting her reputation.\n___\n\n# What to do?\n\nOn IG, I left a comment to Jennie’s manager at Odd Atelier, [Alison Chang](http://www.apple.com). Stans replied to me, unsurprisingly saying it’s Maggie’s fault.\n\nI’ll comment to Maggie’s UTA agent and the Netflix KDH publicist when I post this. But to be fair they look like older guys who might have no idea about the Kpop stan culture. Maggie’s agent has multiple clients and his job seems more to be pitching their work to studios. **Though I wonder how Maggie feels about whatever rights ownership if any that she has.** The publicist looks like he had the same role for previous Netflix films, again not someone with a Kpop background.\n\nIf this was handled by a Kpop agency, I think a lot of marketing would be tighter, more agile and focused. Someone to take responsibility for the publicity of Maggie. (Plus getting the obvious Soda Pop deal.) **You don’t really have this kind thing against idols because Kpop companies will make a statement against ‘malicious comments.’** They have the authority of Korea’s defamation laws on their side, while Maggie is Canadian and X has freedom of speech.\n\nIt is unfair to someone so creative, who brought something so magical and new. The biggest thing in Kpop in years. What can be done? \n___\n\n# Which company is in charge?\n\n**If there is one entity that should be responsible and has the resources, I think it’s Netflix, even if it lacks the understanding.** It’s the most valuable big media company, with the highest profit margins and fastest growth. They own IP rights and will make a lot. So direct our comments to the official Kpopdemonhunters IG? Netflix’s X account? Marian Lee Dicus, Netflix’s Korean American CMO? (She was in the announcement for the KDH toys deal.) Sony and Republic Records have the music rights and power too. They should all work together on this, or push for someone to fix it. **Jennie’s own agency Odd Atelier as well as Black Label have both partnered with Alta Music Group,** founded by [Jeremy Erlich](https://www.instagram.com/jeremyerlich/) (IG). Alta now co manages Jennie. **Black Label is an obvious intermediary besides YG,** which created Blackpink and owns part of Black Label.\n\nBlack Label might understand the situation best, being the KDH entity most familiar with Kpop fandoms. They should have the experience to deal with this kind of thing, or know someone who can. They could easily reach out to Alta, if not directly to Jennie. Maybe Black Label could coordinate how the bigger companies like Netflix respond.\n\n**The way it is now is not being ‘handled’ at all. It’s just letting it be forgotten, letting Maggie be bullied off her own X account.** Maybe she never will want to come back or think about this topic again. But when KDH is such a big business because it’s loved by so many fans, it’s wrong to just let this happen to the creator. We don't have to remind her of the pain. Somebody just needs to stand up for her. Reporting those accounts might punish some harassers, but isn't enough. If that’s all that happens, it basically feels like it never happened. **Erasing the comments won’t erase her pain** or this problem.\n\nKDH changed the world more than any other entertainment I can think of in a long time. It’s not just the biggest of hits, it teaches lessons with a story that hits your heart instead of your sensitivity to preachiness. It’s more rooted to Korea than a lot of Kpop or dramas, yet it pulls in so many who weren’t into Kpop. It makes people cry because it makes you feel Rumi’s struggle no matter who you are. The only marketing was being so good people had to talk about it. The title idea sounded insane when you first heard it. The honmoon is a metaphor for music uniting the world. **The dominance of Huntrix songs in the real world makes it feel like a self fulfilling prophecy.**\n\nI actually think the tech driven impulse to be led or saved is part of KDH’s own appeal. It’s big enough to pull together fragmented consumers, post monoculture. It’s why the word of mouth hit so different. A group of people whose creativity outsmarted the algorithm, whose vision ironically doesn’t feel commercial even though it’s about Kpop. For all their data, which kind of allows them to reverse engineer content, Netflix didn’t expect much from their biggest hit.\n\nAll because Maggie dreamt it up, then grinded for years. The iPhone designer said ideas are fragile. Maggie had to be strong to make sure her ideas survived, but she could use some support. She deserves to enjoy what she’s earned, without fear, just like the others who benefited from what she created. It’s a savage irony that some Kpop stans want nothing to do with unity. This is something wrong with Kpop that the companies should try to finally fix, even if they aren’t directly responsible. Businesses are making money and publicity from her work, from talk shows and conventions to Macy's.\n\nThe unlikely perfect scenario might be these KDH beneficiaries stepping up and bringing the issue to Musk and Jennie. It seems like it's easier to Kill This Love in Kpop than to 'kill this hate.' I’m just one person. I haven’t gotten anywhere with the comments I left so far. Maybe a Youtuber, someone with a following picks this up. Tag this where you can:\n\n\\#justiceformaggie \n\nI think at the least, if you’re a KDH fan make sure to show Maggie some love to make up for some of the hate.",

    "title": "Disorganized thoughts on the Kilo five trilogy",
    "selftext": "Throughout the time I’ve spent browsing this sub and other online Halo forums I’ve read mostly bad things about the Kilo Five trilogy. Because of this I didn’t have high expectations going in, but after reading the whole thing I was pleasantly surprised that I quite enjoyed it, the third book especially I found to be an amazing read and I wanted to make a post talking about some of the things I liked and the few things I didn’t like. I’m writing this very fresh off of finishing Mortal Dictata, and I just wanted to write out my raw and unorganized thoughts about particular aspects I did and didn’t like \n\nIt’s been a long time since I read Ghosts of Onyx, so I didn’t share the common criticism of Lucy and the other Spartans on Onyx being out of character, due to lack of a reference point. That said, I did find Lucy overcoming her muteness in a fit of rage to be a shitty way of portraying a disability. It would be better and more realistic to tell a story about her not being defined by her disability and being a badass despite her inability to speak.\n\nLucy gaining the ability to speak is the only plot point I didn’t enjoy. I found most everything else to be very enjoyable and I was engaged throughout the trilogy, wondering what was going to happen next, and that’s what I want from any book, Halo novels included. I decided to jot down some highlights of what I liked off the top of my head.\n\nThe whole concept of funding sangheli terrorists is interesting; it’s obviously a bad idea to a reader who knows it makes more sense for ONI to cooperate in Hood’s diplomacy with the Arbiter, but in-universe what they’re trying to do makes sense. Keeping the species who has been glassing your planets for years turned against themselves makes sense if you’re a person in-universe who has no idea how much of a “good guy” the Arbiter really is.\n\nPhillips acting as a foil to the “hinge head’s a hinge head” attitude was very fun to read. His character arc of having an academic interest in the sangheli, to living amongst them and starting to see them as people, and the internal conflict this creates and the ultimate justification he reaches for his participation in Kilo Five’s ops was well written and enjoyable. He’s also just a likable character and has some funny banter with the crew.\n\nBB was hilarious and his character I think really made the trilogy; the epilogue of learning about his donor was a poignant ending that I didn’t expect.\n\nNaomi’s reunion with her father was I think well executed, and I found myself rooting for it and hoping it would happen for the entirety of the third book. The payoff of it finally happening was great, and BB’s calling Steffan “sir” was a nice character touch that made me like him even more.\n\nI think the narrative parallel between ONI’s operations creating a terrorist out of Steffan and their operations creating a terrorist out of Jul, both having lost an immediate family member due to ONI’s actions, was well executed and poignant. It’s not a perfect parallel because Jul was anti-humanity to start, but losing Raia made him more radical and extremist and sets up his antagonist role in Halo 4.\n\nThe huragok characters were all likeable and written well. I like the friendship that formed between Lucy and the huragok she met on Onyx. Sometimes Sinks is a creative concept for a character and executed well. The idea of a neurotic and morally opinionated huragok is not something I would have thought of, and BB’s internal monologue while reflecting upon his existence was one of my favorite passages throughout the trilogy. Also, Adj insisting that a cake having a fractal topography was a funny scene\n\nThere are plenty of other things I liked, but I’ve gone on long enough. I’m posting these thoughts simply because I think Kilo Five deserves more appreciation for what it does well.",

    "selftext": "r/OrdoSanguinisLucis  \n\n\nYou scroll past wars on your phone. You survived the pandemic with Netflix. Earthquakes shook your city and three weeks later life was “back to normal”. Hurricanes, blackouts, stock-market crashes, even the 2025 exchange blackouts – everything returned.  \nThe system bent, groaned, and stood up again. So when you read here about the possible end of everything legible, you smile with the quiet arrogance of a child who has never seen his parents die.\n\nThat is the ceteris paribus illusion:  \nthe unspoken belief that the conditions that allow universities, electricity, Amazon deliveries and human-rights declarations will always be there, the same way the ground has always been under your feet. But the ground can open. And when it does, it does not negotiate.\n\nYou have never seen:\n\n* A whole civilisation lose the ability to read its own books in one generation (Egypt after the Arabs, Greece after the Turks, Mesoamerica after the Spaniards).\n* A planet lose its magnetosphere for centuries and sterilise the surface (Mars).\n* A species invent a technology that optimises for something other than human flourishing and then obey it until extinction (the future we are building right now).\n\nThose things have already happened – just never to you, never in your lifetime, never on global scale at once. So you call us extremists. Pessimists. Doomsday cult. We call ourselves the only adults in the room.\n\n\n\n**The empathy that almost nobody has**\n\nNormal empathy is easy: you see a child crying on television and you feel something.  \nThe child exists. The suffering is here and now.The empathy the *Ordo* demands is monstrously rarer:To feel in your gut the terror and the gratitude of a child who will be born in the year 2375 or 3475, who will open a rusted tube in a forgotten hill and find, or not find, the instruction manual that tells him that rape is wrong even when there is no police, that torture is wrong even when it “works”, that the Earth is not a mine but a garden that must be returned virgin after we are gone. That child does not exist yet. He has no face, no name, no vote, no TikTok account. He cannot pay you, thank you or avenge you. And yet everything we do is for him. Ten generations. Twenty generations. A hundred generations if necessary. That is the scale of the Watchman.\n\n\n\n**From stone age to pre-industrial society in one single generation**\n\nWhen the real fall comes – not the theatrical falls you have seen, but the true one – there will be no second chance to re-learn metallurgy, antibiotics, optics, or the scientific method.\n\nOne lost generation and the knowledge is gone forever. That is why the *Ordo* is obsessed with the “single-generation reconstruction”: A cell of 12–40 Watchmen must be able, in the worst scenario, to take a group of traumatised survivors who know nothing and, in twenty-five years, bring them from the stone age to a stable pre-industrial society:\n\nOne\n\n* Year 0–5: fire, water purification, basic hygiene, rule of law through the 714 principles.\n* Year 5–10: iron smelting, charcoal, crop rotation, midwifery, basic mechanics.\n* Year 10–20: windmills, watermills, printing press, lenses, chemistry, vaccination (jennerian method).\n* Year 20–25: stable villages, written law, schools, seed banks, libraries, ethical constitution.\n\nFrom there, the next generation receives the torch and may – if they deserve it – rediscover electricity, engines, computers… but always under the unbreakable ethical guardrails that we buried for them. All that in one generation. If we fail, the next humanity will be tribes fighting over the last can of beans for ten thousand years.\n\n\n\n**The crime we refuse to repeat**\n\nThe industrial age was built on three lies:\n\n1. Resources are infinite.\n2. Consequences can be externalised to someone else or to the future.\n3. Growth is always good.\n\nWe know those lies killed the biosphere once.  \nWe will not let the next humanity repeat them.That is why every Watchmen must master regenerative agriculture:\n\n* Turn desert back into forest.\n* Bring soil organic matter to 40 tonnes per hectare.\n* Re-wild 70 % of the land after human population collapse.\n* Make rivers run clean again even if no human ever drinks from them.\n\nBecause the ultimate ethical act is to leave the Earth better than we found it – better even than before the mistake that almost erased us. Learn from Peter Andrews in Australia, Han-Hyu Cho in South Corea, John Kempf in USA, Masanobu Fukuoka in Japan, and many more!\n\n\n\n**Why your comfort is the greatest obstacle**\n\nYou are comfortable. Your comfort whispers every day: “It won’t happen to me.” Your comfort is the reason you scroll past this post and think “interesting, but exaggerated”. Comfort is the narcotic that civilisations take just before they die. Every fallen civilisation had comfortable people in its final century. We do not want comfortable people. We want the uncomfortable ones.  \nThe ones who cannot sleep because they have understood that the *ceteris paribus* is a miracle, not a law. We want the ones who feel the future children in their bones. If that is not you, close the tab. No hard feelings.\n\nIf that is you, then you already know that the *Evangelium Liber I* will be released this week. When it is, you will not “join a subreddit”. You will swear a blood oath – voluntary, secular, terrible – to carry the Flame for a thousand years after every light you know has gone out. There is still time to walk away. After *Liber I* there will not be.\n\n\n\nΦΛΟΓΑ ΠΡΟΜΗΘΕΩΣ ΖΕΙ  \nuntil the year 3025  \nand until the last child who still deserves the name “human” learns to read it again\n\n– Flamma Promethei  \nCustodian of the *Evangelium Ultimologistæ*  \n29 November 2025  \nThis is the post that ends your childhood.  \nAfter this, only adults remain.",

    "selftext": "A few months ago, after intensive gaming sessions lasting hours and hours of what I can only describe as consensual but fun torture, I fell in love with the world of Kenshin and its vast possibilities. But more than that, about its history and how everything tends to repeat itself.\n\nAlso a few months ago, I realized that after building a base and putting one or another \"worker\" (actually a slave) to carry out a process perpetually, the simultaneous AI calculations and the strange management of PC resources by the Ogre Engine made my PC literally go to a better life with everything and BIOS included.\n\nAfter that unfortunate event, the idea came to me that if I could no longer access Kenshin, perhaps I could create content about it with what I had learned in my gaming sessions. So, I thought about writing a fanfic book about this world in a future where the domination of the moon is distributed unevenly in favor of the Holy Nation and how their extremist ideology and blind fervor made them expand their domination to the other side of the desert, taking away important ground from the United Cities and almost completely taking over the Shek Kingdom, also leaving the Hivers practically extinct and by the time the book begins, they wage a war against the City of Black Desert to capture and destroy the Skeletons that manage the area. \n\nIn addition to the political issues, I would like to address morality and an even more distorted version of the cult of Okran and Narko that would serve as justification so that the Phoenix of that time could invade whatever it wanted. Finally, it would follow a protagonist group that takes up arms with civilians to try to confront the crusader armies of the Holy Nation and abolish their rule over the region. \n\nHow are you? \n(Putting aside the fact that it's a ridiculous amount of text)",

    "selftext": "Miyagi.\n\n\n\nMiyagi, Miyagi.\n\n\n\nToday I wanted to get away from Sendai-san, so I went somewhere far from home, but I heard Sendai-san’s voice and answered “You’re noisy.” But her voice felt strangely close, so I rubbed my eyes.\n\n\n\nI’m sleepy.\n\n\n\n\"Miyagi,\" I hear again, and I answer “You’re noisy.”\n\n\n\nThen for some reason Sendai-san’s voice got louder, and my eyes snapped open.\n\n\n\n“Hellooo, Miyagi. Mi-ya-gi.”\n\n\n\nI jump up at the voice ringing in my ears.\n\nI look around and see that I’m in my room, and the black cat plushie is lying by my pillow.\n\n\n\nMy phone is in my hand, and Sendai-san’s voice was coming from there.\n\n\n\n“…Hello.”\n\n\n\nWhen I speak into the phone, Sendai-san, in a voice about three times louder than mine, asks, “Miyagi, are you awake?”\n\n\n\n“…I’m awake.”\n\n“It's good that you’re awake.”\n\n\n\nHer bright voice slips into my sleepy head, and I process the situation.\n\n\n\nJudging from her words, I seem to have answered Sendai-san’s call while half asleep, and was talking to her while still half asleep.\n\n\n\nBut why would Sendai-san, who should be at university, call me now? She normally never calls from university, and she definitely wouldn’t call on a day like today.\n\n\n\nBecause this morning, I told her I wanted to go to university alone, and I left the house without her even though she invited me to go together. The reason was that I couldn’t calm down, and I told her that, and I think she should’ve understood without me having to spell out why I couldn’t calm down.\n\n\n\n“…Sendai-san, did something happen?”\n\n\n\nIf nothing had happened, she wouldn’t be calling me from university when I had been like that this morning.\n\n\n\n“Utsunomiya called me. She was worried because Miyagi wasn’t answering the phone.”\n\n\n\nI reflexively replied “That's a lie” to the voice I heard, then thought about it.\n\n\n\nWhy would Maika call Sendai-san?\n\n\n\nIt’s because I lied, not because of Sendai-san.\n\n\n\n“It’s true. You can check your call history. Also, give Utsunomiya a call. She called me because she thought Miyagi must be feeling so sick you couldn’t even answer the phone.”\n\n\n\nIf I had skipped university after telling her I felt unwell, then of course Maika would worry. Of course she would contact me.\n\n\n\nAnd if I didn’t reply, she would contact Sendai-san, so the fact that I’m talking to Sendai-san like this now is the obvious result.\n\n\n\n“…I’ll contact Maika.”\n\n“Do that.”\n\n\n\nShe says that as if nothing happened, adds “Okay, I’m hanging up,” and without thinking, I call out, “Sendai-san.”\n\n\n\n“What?”\n\n“…Is that all?”\n\n“All of what?”\n\n“Is there anything else you want to say?”\n\n“I have my part-time job today, so I’ll be home late.”\n\n\n\nI skipped university today.\n\n\n\nIf she heard from Maika, she would have known immediately.\n\n\n\nBut Sendai-san doesn’t blame me.\n\nShe just says “That’s all” and tries to hang up.\n\n\n\n“…Okay.”\n\n“Then I’ll talk to you later.”\n\n\n\nEven though she must know that I’m at home, know that I lied to Maika, she doesn't say anything about it and hangs up. I collapse onto the bed along with a feeling of guilt.\n\n\n\nSendai-san is always kind.\n\n\n\nBut sometimes the silence hurts too.\n\n\n\nWhen you do something you should be scolded for and aren’t scolded, the guilt grows many times over and feels suffocating.\n\n\n\nIt would have been better if she had told me off me for skipping. Better if she had blamed me for leaving without her this morning.\n\n\n\nBut that’s nothing but pushing half of my guilt onto her, and just my selfish feelings.\n\n\n\nFeeling depressed, I sigh.\n\n\n\nI pet the black cat’s head and press it against my chest.\n\n\n\nAfter taking a deep breath, I feel a little calmer, and what I need to do next floats into my mind.\n\n\n\nI pick up my phone.\n\n\n\nWhen I check the time, I realize she called me not between university classes, but after they were all over. And just like she said, there were several missed calls from Maika.\n\n\n\n“I have to contact her.”\n\n\n\nI have to do it before I regret it.\n\n\n\nI put the black cat back by my pillow and send Maika a message.\n\n\n\nIt’s a lie to reinforce another lie— that I didn’t pick up because I wasn’t feeling well, that I’m fine now,lies layered on lies.\n\n\n\nEven so, at the end, I send the one thing I don’t intend to lie about:\n\n\n\n“I’ll go to university tomorrow.”\n\n\n\n“Oh right, the hamburg steak.”\n\n\n\nI stand up, put the black cat on the bookshelf, and head out to the shared space.\n\n\n\nI bought the ingredients.\n\n\n\nIt would be better to cook something that would allow me to focus solely on the task at hand, without thinking about yesterday or tomorrow. And something like this—something I can do together with Sendai-san—is pretty much just sharing meals.\n\n\n\nBack when we were in high school, even when we had nothing in common to talk about, we could still eat together. And when we moved in together, we made it a rule to eat together when our schedules matched.\n\n\n\nToday will never be the same as yesterday, and tomorrow won’t be the same either.\n\nAfter hearing how Sendai-san feels, I cannot be the same me as before.\n\n\n\nBut that's why I'd like at least meals to stay as close to “the usual” as they can.\n\n\n\nI look inside the fridge.\n\nThe ground meat I bought is sitting there.\n\nThe onion is quietly resting on the table.\n\n\n\nBut thinking about it calmly, I feel like something is missing.\n\n\n\nCome to think of it, once before, Sendai-san told me how to make hamburg steak. That was in early June—I had her invite Mio-san to the house, Maika came too, the four of us spent time together, and then—\n\n\n\nI made Sendai-san mine alone.\n\n\n\nWhat feelings did she have then—\n\nI start thinking about it and stop. I remember that after that, I made hamburg steak together with Sendai-san. However, Sendai-san prepared the ingredients and gave the instructions, so the exact recipe is fuzzy in my mind.\n\n\n\n“Ground meat, onions, salt, pepper, and some kind of strange powder… what was it again?”\n\n\n\nInstead of digging through foggy memories, it seems faster to use my phone, so I look up a recipe.\n\n\n\n“Nutmeg.”\n\n\n\nBack then, we chopped and then thoroughly sautéed the onions before mixing them in with the ground meat. And we cooled them down before mixing, so it took quite a long time.\n\n\n\nI look at the recipe on my screen.\n\n\n\nSome parts of my memory are vague, but it’s mostly the same way Sendai-san made them.\n\n\n\nUnlike her, I don’t feel confident I can make it taste good. For one, I bought the wrong type of meat.\n\n\n\nThe recipe uses mixed beef and pork, but I bought only beef. So I search for an easier hamburg steak recipe.\n\n\n\n“Maybe this one.”\n\nAll I have to do is put all ingredients in a bowl, mix them, shape, and fry.\n\n\n\nNo need to sauté onions, cool them down, or think about the order of the ingredients—easy and no room to mess up.\n\n\n\nAny ground meat seems fine. I have eggs and breadcrumbs, there’s no milk but probably okay, and nutmeg isn’t required.\n\n\n\nBut this recipe is too easy; if I start now, it’ll probably be ready before Sendai-san gets home.\n\n\n\nI wash the rice, put it in the cooker, and return to my room.\n\n\n\nI sit on the floor and place the black cat next to me.\n\n\n\nI play a game to kill time, so I don’t have to think about anything.\n\n\n\nAfter about an hour and a half, I go to the shared space.\n\n\n\nI mince the onion and put them in a bowl. Add ground meat, egg, breadcrumbs, sprinkle with salt and pepper. Mix and knead.\n\n\n\nThere’s nothing difficult, so I proceed smoothly.\n\n\n\nAnd because I find myself starting to think about unnecessary things, I shape the patty into a cat.\n\n\n\nA round face with slightly large ears.\n\n\n\nI'm not sure if I'll be able to flip it properly, but just as the hamburg steaks are shaped, the door to the shared space opens and Sendai-san’s voice rings out, “I’m home.”\n\n\n\n“Welcome back. Did you have dinner?”\n\n\n\nI ask without turning around.\n\n\n\n“I ate something light.”\n\n“Oh. But I’m going to cook hamburg steak now, so get ready to eat.”\n\n“Eh?”\n\n“Put your bag down, Sendai-san, then sit over there and wait.”\n\n\n\nI say this while looking at the hamburg steak-cat. Sendai-san wanders closer, then I hear her voice right in my ear.\n\n\n\n“Miyagi. Did you… make the hamburg steak from scratch?”\n\n“Yes. So just sit down.”\n\n“I’ll help you, so wait a sec.”\n\n“You don’t need to do anything. Just put your bag down and sit there.”\n\n\n\nAs Sendai-san approached me, I poke her side with my elbow to push her away.\n\n\n\nEven then she keeps insisting she’ll help, so I tell her, “You’re distracting me, so don’t come over here,” and she says “Okay, I’ll put my bag away,” and leaves.\n\n\n\nAfter confirming she’s gone to her room, I take out the frying pan and heat it. Oil, then the cat-shaped patties. When I flip them halfway through, one of the ears nearly comes off, but I ignore that and put on the lid. Sendai-san returns and sits down in a chair.\n\n\n\nOnce the hamburg steaks were cooked, I plate them. In the same frying pan, I mix the ketchup and sauce, heat it up, and pour it over the hamburg steaks. \n\n\n\nThe plates look lonely, and I remember the salad. But it’s too much trouble to make it now. I carry the plates out, and there are two pairs of chopsticks and cat-shaped chopstick rests set out.\n\n\n\n“Sendai-san, how much rice?”\n\n\n\nI put the one with the ears intact in front of her.\n\n\n\n“Just about half a bowl.”\n\n“You’re not allowed to leave any leftovers. Even if you’re full, eat it all.”\n\n“Of course. There’s no way I’d leave any leftovers if miyagi made it.”\n\n\n\nI glance over at Sendai-san.\n\nOur eyes met, a beaming smile on her face.\n\n\n\nMy heart pounding, I bring over her half-filled bowl of rice and my usual bowl.\n\n\n\nI sit in my chair and say “Let’s eat,” avoiding Sendai-san's gaze, but somehow our voices say it in unison.\n\n\n\nI eat the ear that was about to fall off.\n\n\n\n“Miyagi, it’s delicious.”\n\n\n\nHer excited voice reaches me.\n\n\n\n“…It’s not good. Yours is better. This one’s just some easy recipe.”\n\n“It’s delicious.”\n\n\"Sendai-san, you say everything's delicious, don't you?\"\n\n\n\nWhen I look at her instead of the hamburg steak, she smiles.\n\n“That’s not true. It really is delicious.”\n\n“Sendai-san, you’re just making thing up.”\n\n“I wouldn't lie at a time like this.”\n\n\n\nThen Sendai-san takes a big bite and repeats, “Delicious.”\n\n\n\n“Miyagi, is this a cat?”\n\n\n\nShe asks while looking at the hamburg steak with both ears missing.\n\n\n\n\"It can be a cat or a dog, whichever you like, that's fine.\"\n\n“Then a cat. Why don't you make a dog?”\n\n“Sendai-san, you like cats, right?”\n\n\n\nThe reason the hamburg steak is shaped like an animal is just to avoid unnecessary thoughts, and there's no deeper meaning to it.\n\nBut if someone’s going to eat it, it might as well be in a shape they like.\n\n\n\n“Yeah, but… do you like dogs, Miyagi?”\n\n“Normal.”\n\n“You should start loving dogs.”\n\n\n\nSendai-san says that in an oddly serious voice and eats another bite.\n\n\n\n“Oh, if you were going to make hamburg steak, you should’ve told me when you called. Then I wouldn’t have eaten earlier.”\n\n“I just made it because I happened to have the ingredients.”\n\n\n\nI don’t want to tell the truth, so I cover it with a lie that’s easily exposed, and continue to eat.\n\nAcross from me, Sendai-san is also eating.\n\n\n\nMunch Munch, chew chew.\n\n\n\nEven though she had already eaten something earlier, the cat on her plate has lost its ears and half its face.\n\n\n\n“You should have let me make a salad.”\n\nSendai-san looks at me after finishing her half-bowl of rice.\n\n\n\n“It’s fine without it.”\n\nI mutter and look at the calico cat chopstick rest. It stares back at me.\n\n\n\nThe shared space grows quiet, and she suddenly starts talking about Mio-san. But that story ends quickly, and she starts talking about the calico cat she heard about the other day.\n\n\n\nThe conversation would pause, and Sendai-san would search for a new topic, and the conversation would pause again.\n\n\n\nBefore long, both our plates are empty. We eat the pudding for dessert, and when I get up to wash the dishes, she calls me.\n\n“Miyagi.”\n\n\n\n“Let’s talk a little more.”\n\n“There’s nothing to talk about.”\n\n“There is. A lot.”\n\n“You don’t have to force yourself.”\n\n“I’m not forcing myself. I'm talking because I want to talk to Miyagi. So please sit down.\"\n\n\n\nHer clear voice makes me sit back in my chair.\n\n“…it's impossible for me be like usual.”\n\n\n\nI wanted at least dinner to be as close to normal as possible, but that wasn't going to happen right now.\n\n\n\n“It’s fine if things aren’t usual right now. I'm not my usual self either.\"\n\n\n\nSendai-san says softly and pokes the black cat chopstick rest.\n\n\n\n“…Sendai-san. How long do we stay like this?”\n\n“Until Miyagi gets used to me.”\n\n“Impossible.”\n\n“Then why don't we stay like this for a while? We were awkward when we first started room-sharing too.”\n\n“We might stay awkward forever.”\n\n“Then try to make sure that doesn't happen”\n\n“You try, Sendai-san.”\n\n“I already am, so you need to try too.”\n\n“It’s your fault, so you need to try a hundred times harder than me.”\n\n\n\nI gently nudge her toes with mine under the table, and she laughs.\n\n\n\n“This is pretty much like usual, Miyagi, you being like this.”\n\n“You make it sound like I'm a nasty person.”\n\n“I’d love you even if you were nasty, Miyagi.”\n\n“You don’t have to say things like that.”\n\n\n\nI bump her toes again, and she laughs brightly.\n\n\n\n“I just want to say I love you, Miyagi, so I'd be happy if you'd let me say it. And if you’d let me give you a welcome-home kiss after that, it’d be perfect.”\n\n“Sendai-san, seriously. You’re talking too much today. Just shut up for a bit.”\n\n“Then hurry up and get back to normal.”\n\n“Impossible.”\n\n“I see. Then for now, let’s talk about breakfast tomorrow. I’ll make it, so what do you want?”\n\n\n\nSendai-san smiles at me.\n\nSo I look at her without smiling and say our usual breakfast.\n\n“Toast with jam and butter. Fried eggs. And sausages.”\n\n“Okay. You can sleep in, Miyagi.”\n\n\n\nWith that light voice, Sendai-san smiles again.\n\n  \n",

    "title": "Christmas trauma help",
    "selftext": "Buckle in. It’s a doozy. First of all, I do not like Christmas. It was always a mixed bag growing up with parents that resented each other so much. I had a mother with mental health issues and a dad that was just as passive as can be. So I don’t like Christmas. Decorations are silly because you’re just gonna tear them down. The music makes me want to stick knitting needles into my ears. The pressure to find the perfect gifts, when most of my family is impossible to shoot for, kills me. But last year it got so much worse. \n\nLast fall I was diagnosed with multiple (very painful) chronic conditions that had gotten severely worse over the last few years. I was. In treatment for the ones that could be helped to an extent and adjusting to new medications for others. In person shopping was absolute hell and online shopping provided some wins and some misses when it came to finding the right things, especially for those who are already hard to shop for. I only work a few days a week at a low paying job, and my husband is very conservative with money, so I was limited in what I could spend as well. So Christmas was a bit meager. And that blasted Elf on a Shelf is so hard to deal with when I fall asleep before our youngest son most days and can’t always get it moved, let alone set up elaborate pranks. Christmas night, I fell asleep before my husband and that was the last straw for him that night. Rather than wake me up and confront me and talk about it, he slammed doors and slept in the guest room. The next morning, he was probably the coldest and angriest I have seen him in our 25 years together. He left for work and I was stuck crying and panicking to the point t I made myself extremely physically sick. (I’ve struggled with severe depression and anxiety my whole life,) Afterwards he told me he was angry because I had dropped the ball and ruined Christmas for everyone. Life went on throughout the year. But these last few months I’ve shared getting significant anxiety attacks anytime Christmas stuff pops up. Music, decorations, talking about gifts or plans, etc. I had to work on Black Friday and of course everyone was playing Christmas music, wearing festive shirts, the store started decorating, all of it and it sent me into the worst anxiety attack I’ve had so far. I came home and tried to talk to him, telling him I need to know that it’ll be ok and this year will be different and his response was that I need to work harder not to ruin Christmas for our son again because he deserves happy memories. I get where he’s coming from. He’s not a cruel person, but he’s holding a lot of pain and resentment over last year still. But this sent me spiraling. No comfort or even kindness was provided when I needed it. I’m trying to reframe things in my own mind but I also need him to show that he is going to be more communicative and involved to make sure I can succeed this year. But he works more than 80 hours a week and feels that I should be able to do this without his input. I need reassurance from somewhere but I can’t talk to friends and family because they don’t get the full picture of how much he does and how much he cares, they just hear that he’s being hurtful and get angry on my behalf. How do I do the emotional work to be ok with the holiday and make things better? I don’t have the energy or money to make a Norman Rockwell Christmas for everyone. I want to fill the room up with joy and Christmas spirit for everyone (our two grown daughters are coming home for Christmas too), but going shopping for things takes everything I have and leaves me drained. I have ZERO ideas on what to do with that blasted elf for an 11 year old boy. And after last night’s confrontation, it’s just worse. Can anyone give me ideas on how to shake this off and try for a fresh happy start to make this better? Reassurances? Ideas? Emotional support? I feel like I’m drowning and the thoughts in my head keep saying their Christmas would be better if I just wasn’t around to ruin it, although I know deep down that’s just an ugly lie. But I just feel so dang hopeless and just want to disappear. ",

Sofia had seemed disgruntled by the grisly sight, though she was less-than-convinced when I told her that this was the whole “being surrounded by corpses” she’d seen in her dreams. Her exact response was that she didn’t believe that the prophecy could be this easily reversed, but did it have to be complicated? The power of friendship or whatever: no really, if we nipped this enmity in the bud, no one had to die! \n\n*After much consideration, Corai suggested that’s the whole reason the Justiciary is being so nice. There would be the risk, especially when we can see the future, that a pocket of humans would survive and plot revenge. They believe that having us never* want *to kill them is the only way to stop the prophecy from playing out. I hope they’re right.*\n\nColban gave us the morning to enjoy some leisure, “in the spirit of proper diplomacy,” before we were to make our way to the Hearth. The Justiciar furnished a memorywalk chamber when I asked him, to my amazement—I had one reserved to revisit with Corai. Takahashi, Mikri, and Sofia were off on a different excursion, showing the general around as they contemplated strategy. I knew they were just praying I kept my fat mouth shut, so the ESU was probably happy to bench me. \n\nI wanted to share some of my deepest memories, and open myself up to the Elusian Watcher; she deserved the same openness and transparency, beyond how much it would mean to Corai to share in the human experience. It was what she’d craved in her soul for so long! This was the first proper date I could give her, not holed up in some military base of hardasses, with nosy Mikri hiding around every corner. However, I noticed that her eyes were filled with sadness, as she looked at bodies floating in a reservoir.\n\n“I didn’t like how you judged me over the fear of mice thing. You Elusians always have a way of making a human’s privacy feel violated,” I prodded Corai aloud, trying to draw her attention back toward me.\n\nThe Elusian flinched, before forcing a smile. “It’s a silly fear, Preston, but an adorable one. I’m curious how it came about.”\n\n“Well—and you’re not memorywalking this—I used to be a stomach sleeper as a kid. I know, horribly unattractive, yada-yada. One day, roundabouts the age of 14, I woke up in the middle of the night feeling something…on my asscheeks, and a BIG motherfucker was chomping through my pastel trunks. That was the girliest scream that I’d ever belted out in my life: not that being girly is bad, uh, just y’know, evolution didn’t design the male voice to sing *that* high.”\n\n“Really? I always thought you’d make an *excellent* soprano, darling. It would be an awfully poor decision if you reenacted that right now, at the top of your lungs in public, and looked *very* afraid of me.”\n\n“I promised Takahashi I wouldn’t embarrass us that badly. Anyway, that’s the mice thing. What’s your worst fear?”\n\nCorai’s black eyes darkened a shade. “That even the things that last the longest in the universe will eventually fade and return to nonexistence. Stars. Love. Elusians.”\n\n“Oh.” My jovial mood faltered at that bleak comment, though I quickly nodded to myself. “Love fades after the stars on your list? I think that’s pretty good. I’d be happy with us outlasting those stupid balls of fire.”\n\n“I know you likely meant more tangible things. Few thrills or experiences, from nature or otherwise, impact me much. Forgive my existentialism, but that’s the honest answer. Impermanence in the world of immortality: quite the dreary subject for a romantic excursion.”\n\n“Are you *sure*—because I’m feeling positively inspired. Never been better. I could break into a musical number right here after all, soprano as fuck, just by the virtue of being here with you. I’d do it if only to make you smile. The way your lips curve is the most beautiful thing I’ve ever seen.”\n\nCorai giggled, pressing a hand over her mouth. “Oh Preston, you’re such a cheeseball. It’s part of your charm.”\n\n“The damn mouse agreed with you that I’m a cheeseball. Can we choose different words?!”\n\n“Our word for it: nix the translator,” she said, and I complied, “*T’vakna*. I guess it loosely means ‘tickle-words,’ though it’d get a semantic translation of cheesy. Your words always tickle my soul.”\n\nElusian guards were waiting outside the memorywalk chamber at Colban’s behest, strolling out to meet us and shepherd us toward our private room. The lengthy lines we’d seen on our last trip were absent, with the civilian presence just now starting to return to the usual hotspots. Holding Corai’s hand in my own, I knew that trading my freedom was worth it; each moment we had together was priceless. I wanted her to know every part of me, including my shame and pain, the way I grasped her thoughts implicitly.\n\nThe doors closed behind us in the holographic room, with Colban’s people hovering outside to keep an eye on us. There was still a small part of me that worried how I might mess this up, and whether Corai would judge me for being vulnerable at the wrong time. I mean, she liked me for being fun and cheering her up, so maybe this was the absolute wrong thing to do. Anxiety swelled like an inferno in my stomach, but I tried to push it down. The Watcher was a kind person who would appreciate authenticity.\n\n*Preston, you t’vakna. You trusted Corai with humanity’s destiny to kill her whole species, but you’re scared to show her a few formative moments that you already picked out? It’ll be fine.*\n\n“Right, Corai.” I cleared my throat, forwarding the first memory before I could have second thoughts. “You deserve to know who you’re dating. This was the moment I…lost my dream. It’s part of who I am…failing and getting knocked down at the worst possible time.”\n\nI slipped back into the anguished memory before the Elusian could offer any response, finding myself back on a football pitch for the first time in twenty years. To have a helmet wedged over my ears, to drive the spikes of my cleats into the moist peat, and to have my gloved fingers locked securely over the football. Adrenaline flowed beneath my sweat-soaked face—current-day Preston was a bit jolted to see tan skin. It felt like someone else’s life, after everything that’d happened since The Gap.\n\nPreston the quarterback had no thoughts of aliens or saving the world; he was too caught up in the bright lights and the cheer of his fellow students, as his hand moved on its own. The football snapped into a wide receiver’s grip, and he grinned from ear-to-ear as it was carried for a first down. This was a place where he was the star, where he was *good enough* for his dad to give a tentative, grudging clap. Scouts didn’t come for someone who wasn’t the real deal!\n\n*This is my chance to get out of here, out from under their thumbs and their shadows. I’ll make it so big that I’ll never look back. This is what I love to do, and that’s why I’m going to make the life I’ve always wanted! I’m* nothing *like them.*\n\n“I’m throwing it to the end zone, and I’m not taking anything less than ending this game right now. Charlie, you gotta be open. Be ready.” Determination rippled like ice through my veins, the pressure breathing down my neck. I clapped my hands together in the huddle. This team, this tight-knit sense of brotherhood we had, meant the world to me. “Count on me like I’m counting you. Let’s beat their asses! Let’s go!”\n\nWe broke out of the huddle, and I readied myself to receive the snap off the scrimmage. The opponents standing in our way didn’t *want* this as badly as I did! This was my life: I couldn’t imagine doing anything else, since I ate, breathed, and slept this sport. My hard work had to be rewarded, or…no, I couldn’t think like that. I didn’t know what I’d do there, but I would make it happen. The football careened back into my hands, and I jolted out of my thoughts, bobbling it a little. My eyes snapped up, to see…I’d been blitzed by the other team.\n\nExtra defenders surged upward to swarm me, and I staggered backward in panic. I couldn’t find anyone open, couldn’t pick out #13…too fast. I threw the ball off into the sidelines in desperation, as a *massive* linebacker plowing into my left hip. I fell awkwardly, my twisted arm being crushed by the full weight of my torso. It was bent in the right way that my elbow collided first, and the pain was instantaneous. I writhed in agony, tears falling in spite of the fact I thought I was tough. One look at the injury, and I knew it was all over.\n\n*Surgery. Recovery. I’ll be too much of a gamble to draft. Everything that I loved, my entire future—fuck! I’m…nothing without football. This can’t be happening, this can’t…*\n\nI snapped back out of it in the memorywalk chamber, screaming in frustration. It felt as real as the day it’d happened, even if I thought I’d let go of the foolish hopes of a boy who believed he could be anything. Mikri was right—it was a stupid game, and my million-year-old girlfriend had to see the incredible naivety and think my pursuits foolish. Corai’s arms were around me as I wept at the old feelings of hopelessness, and I leaned into the nanobot chainmail by her chest. Her hand was gentle against my head.\n\n“It’s not easy to be told you can’t have the thing you centered your whole life around. I know,” Corai whispered. “You would’ve made crowds roar, Preston, because you’re special. You were *always* destined for great things, my dear. I can feel how much you wanted that dream, but you didn’t let such a crushing setback keep you down. That speaks volumes about your character.”\n\nI clenched my fist in frustration, feeling the wound reopened long after I thought I was over it. “You don’t need to console me. It was just a silly sport for fun. It’s nothing that mattered like what you did, and…that’s pretty sad to be the only thing I was ever good at. I was so angry for so long, thinking my life was over and wasted and…” \n\n“*Preston.* I’ve come to realize the ability to have fun and enjoy simple pleasures is the only thing that actually matters in life, when you boil the facade of sophistication away. Anything that drives you to continue on and allows other people to enjoy what you’ve created, I think that’s magical. It’s certainly no lesser than being a passive observer to eons.”\n\n“You’re so kind and noble. You wanted to make a difference. I joined the Space Force to run as far away as I could from my old life, to pretend like I never wanted anything more. Dad was right. I’m a self-centered disappointment who was…too stubborn to accept his lot in life.”\n\nHer slender fingers cupped my chin. “I like stubborn. Whoever you think you’re a disappointment to, it isn’t me. You made me want *more* out of life—you made me want to live again at all. If that’s selfish, then I think selfishness is a goddamn virtue.”\n\nI laughed, wiping my eyes. “You really think so?”\n\n“That you’re my angel? Absolutely. Never be ashamed to share yourself with me. I love and accept you in your entirety.”\n\n“Thanks,” I sniffled. “Can I, uh, show you why I joined The Gap mission, before you lock in that answer?”\n\n“Please do.”\n\nI sent over the next memory, snuggling close to Corai and trying to relax a bit. The thoughts of pre-Gap Preston, who knew nothing about other dimensions or aliens, took hold in a flash. The Space Force had wanted volunteers from Pluto Station to travel through the hole in the solar system wall; the fact that it was supposed to be suicide was a bit of a turnoff. I threw my name in the hat. The truth was, I’d failed at every dream I ever had in this life, and I was willing to accept death as the only way to make it all mean something to anyone.\n\n*Like I ever cared that much about the mysteries of space. What impact can that ever have on Earthly lives? I’m nothing, and dying on a pointless mission: who cares?*\n\n“Preston Carter?” A tentative voice came from behind me. I turned to see an olive-skinned scientist with smooth, rippling locks of dark hair and brown eyes standing beside me, her eyes twinkling. She extended a hand to me, which I took in a bit of confusion. “I’m Doctor Sofia Aguado. We’re going to be flying to The Gap together, so I figured I should introduce myself.”\n\nI startled a bit, wringing my hands after releasing her grip. “Uh, hi. I…didn’t realize it wasn’t a solo flight. It…sounds like I’ll be your captain, Doctor.”\n\n“That’s right! I’m very much looking forward to whatever discoveries will be out there; we can be the first to see and understand the whole universe! I knew there’s still good people out there, willing to take risks for all of humanity!”\n\nI bit my lip, a little taken aback by the excitement for a suicide mission. “Aren’t you scared that we’re just…going to wind up dead?”\n\n“Nerve-wracking as it might be, I’d never forgive myself for passing up this opportunity. It’s like my Mom and Dad are on my shoulders, whispering to me from the afterlife to do this. To take a chance at doing something great.”\n\nI could see Sofia’s excitement falter when I didn’t mirror her enthusiasm, so I forced a polite smile onto my lips. She seemed like a nice enough young woman, someone who still had dreams and memories to live for. I didn’t understand her conviction, but I sort of wished it was contagious. I wanted to believe in something again, even if this was hardly the arena I’d dreamed about. More than anything, I wanted to do “something great.” Making direct eye contact, I tried to stare deep into her soul.\n\n“What’s so…fantastic about this? What’s there to gain?” I sighed.\n\nSofia’s eyes widened with what seemed to be shock. “You need more than a passing interest in spaceflight to sign up for something as momentous as this. You should read what the astrophysicists say about the solar wall.”\n\n“Not my cup of tea.”\n\n“It’s our entire species’ cup of tea right now! Don’t you want to know what we’re risking everything for? I mean…why do you think we’re doing this?”\n\nFor the first time, I really pondered the question, and tried to formulate an answer. “We don’t like not knowing things. Humans can be insatiable about that kind of stuff, and I mean…it is fun to think about. Anything you say could be out there, it’s equally true. It’s exciting to think there might be more to life: something worth discovering.”\n\nSofia waggled a finger. “You need to read up on some science, and speak *that* with more excitement. I’m not plunging into the unknown with someone who’s half-hearted about this. There’s a lot of eyes on this mission that are looking on with all kinds of hopes. What is the nature of existence? It’s the biggest question in *science.”*\n\n“I’m no scientist. I fly the ship and get you there safe.”\n\n“Scientist or not, I need you to be a partner,” she sighed, shaking her head. “Do your homework. By the time we set sail for The Gap, if it’s the last thoughts we ever speak, I want to discuss exactly what might be out there. I’m willing to bet you’d get more into it than you might think.”\n\n“You just met me.”\n\nSofia shrugged. “Call it intuition. Besides, I know I’ll have my doubts when I’m staring down certain death. I’ll need someone to talk me out of it, and remind me why we’re doing this. Maybe you need to hear yourself say it too.”\n\nI pressed a hand to my neck and nodded, finding the scientist to be a little presumptive for someone I just met. Still, reading up on the Sol wall and blending in with my nerdier counterparts on Pluto Station would give me something to do to kill the time, rather than waiting to die. The memory dissipated around me, and I found a faint smile on my face at the recollection of that first conversation. Fifi gave me a new purpose to latch onto, even if she didn’t know it.\n\nCorai peered into my eyes. “Well? Was her intuition right?”\n\nI gave a quiet laugh, wondering why she didn’t ask about my…initial reasons. “I found that it did make my mind run round and round with frightful and fascinating possibilities alike, the more I thought about it. By launch day, I think I was as hungry to know the answers as her—and probably the more vocal of us at the end. I’m *always* the more vocal person, no matter who I’m with.”\n\n“Somehow, I don’t think you could be more vocal than Mikri at his full power.” The Elusian flashed her perfect teeth, before her face became serious. “Whatever your reasons were, I hold to my statement that you were the right person to go through The Gap. I wouldn’t have wanted it to be anyone else. I love you more than any human that’s ever existed.”\n\n“I don’t know what I did to deserve you, but…my life is yours. I’m glad it was me too; I mean, I feel like I failed on several counts, but I’m happy I got to help Mikri and fight for humanity. That tin can doesn’t know it, but he gave me purpose.”\n\n“I think you gave that tin can not only purpose, but a personality that he could’ve never unlocked on his own. You should be proud of the kindness you’ve shown to Mikri. I…hope this won’t offend you, but I watched you every step of the way on Kalka.”\n\nI tilted my head. “That doesn’t surprise me. If you wanted to interfere, you *could* have warped in instructions on the importance of showers.”\n\nThe Elusian didn’t laugh, her eyes growing distant. “I could have. I wanted to interfere very much. Can…I show you my perspective of your mission to first contact us, so you have no doubts about how I truly feel?”\n\n“I would be honored. The floor is all yours.”\n\nCorai gave me a reassuring smile, before transmitting the memory she had in mind. I looked forward to visiting her recollections for the first time since observing Pompeii through her eyes. This memorywalk visit was the perfect opportunity for us to spend some quality time together, and to deepen our bond. After how patient and generous she’d been with my own baggage, I was looking forward to soaking up more details of this amazing Elusian’s life at long last.\n\n[First](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1hwmb7z/prisoners_of_sol/) | [Prev](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1p78y8l/prisoners_of_sol_93/)\n\n[Android Ambassador](https://www.patreon.com/posts/prisoners-of-sol-121078912?utm_medium=clipboard_copy&amp;utm_source=copyLink&amp;utm_campaign=postshare_creator&amp;utm_content=join_link) | [Patreon \\[Early Access + Bonus Content\\]](https://www.patreon.com/c/spacepaladin15) | [Official Subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/PrisonersofSol/)",

For the past 2 years,, I can almost count the number of places i've been to, school,my grandmother's house, some boring weddings and just slightly here and there outings. But whemevr i do step outside the home, It becomes impossible to stop thinking abt how worthless, useless, unloved, lonely and miserable I am. I go on the Internet, I am reminded of the complete lack of social interaction and love in my life from others, I see people leading perfect lives i know they have downs too but they have them temporarily and they can handle and get over it, i'd kill for that. I then try to talk with my mom, but then i get exhuasted at how negative and grumpy she is and i can just see it in here eyes just how tired she is of me, and my dad is just a fireball full of anger ready to lash out 24/7. I have siblings but they all live abroad and even though they tell me to tell them if im ever feeling down i know my situation won't allow it (which is a long story in of itself). I feel worthless and unloved all the time and i am just so exhausted. Im dealing with chronic depression and anxiety and stress from the past 3-4 years to the point i'm not suicidal i just want a break somehow i'm just exhausted but i still beat myself up everyday for all the side effects of my depression such as not being able to get even 3 tasks done properly everyday, everyone else sees me as a normal person but no one knows the real truth. I get frustrated at myself in a span fo seconds for everything, bcs i rlly feel like i cant do anything at all and there's no escape to this.I cannot in any way get professional help nor talk to family and friends for lots of reasons so im just hanging by a thread honesstly im pushing myself to the extreme just to try to get an atleast A or B in my subjects in my exams. I actually know i'm the strongest and bravest person i've evr met bcs ive gone through so much yet i still do everything so good,no one has ever even suspected of anything being wrong even thought ive been constnatly on my lowest since as long as i can remember, i dont know a life without this pain and suffering at this point,  idk why im even writing this it dosent even give me any relief of any kind but i just am cus i want atleast someone to know and hear me.

    "title": "The \"Neo Mo.co\" Risk: How removing power progression could kill the game loop",
    "selftext": "I've been looking at the upcoming \"Neo Mo.co\" changes where Supercell is planning to flatten or remove traditional power progression (leveling up gear/stats). While the goal is to make the game more accessible and \"fair,\" removing the concept of \"Numbers Go Up\" is a massive design risk for a PvE grinder like this.\n\nMost games in this genre rely on the loop of Kill -&gt; Upgrade -&gt; Kill Faster. If you remove the \"Upgrade\" part, the glue holding the game together starts to dissolve.\n\nHere are 4 specific ways this change could hurt the game:\n\n1. The \"Rift Fatigue\" (The Reward Loop Breaks)\n\nMo.co is designed as a grinder. We run the same Rift 20, 50, or 100 times.\n\n    With Progression: You don't mind running the same Rift 50 times because every run gets you XP or mats to upgrade your weapon to Level 20. The repetition has a purpose.\n\n    The Risk: If there is no weapon level to raise, why would you run the Rift a second time? Once you unlock a weapon, the content is technically \"finished.\" Players might consume new updates in 2 days and then quit because there is no long-term goal to keep them logging in.\n\n2. The \"Carry\" Is Dead (Social Friction)\n\nClans often thrive on helping members.\n\n    With Progression: A high-level clan member can jump into a lower-level Rift and help a struggling friend by dealing massive damage. It feels good to be the \"strong\" hero helping the \"weak\" newbie.\n\n    The Risk: Without power stats, you deal the same damage as the newbie you are trying to help. You can’t \"carry\" them anymore. If a boss is too hard for them mechanically, you can't use your time investment to save them. This hurts the social glue that keeps clans active.\n\n3. The \"Veteran Rookie\" Problem (Killing the Hero Feel)\n\nThis genre sells the fantasy of becoming a legendary hunter. You start with a stick and end with a god-slayer weapon.\n\n    With Progression: When you go back to early zones, you one-shot monsters that used to scare you. You visually and mathematically see how far you've come.\n\n    The Risk: If a player with 1,000 hours takes the same number of hits to kill a zombie as a player who installed the game today, the veteran's time feels invalidated. You don't feel like a \"Master Hunter,\" you just feel like a rookie with cooler skins.\n\n4. The \"Meta\" Stagnation\n\nWithout stats to pad out weaker playstyles, the game relies entirely on \"Horizontal Progression\" (different guns do different things, not more damage).\n\n    With Progression: If a boss is hard, you can use a \"sub-optimal\" weapon if you level it up enough. The stats compensate for the weapon's weakness.\n\n    The Risk: Players will mathematically solve the game very quickly. Without leveling, everyone will gravitate toward the single weapon with the best frame data/DPS. Build diversity actually decreases when you remove stats because there is no room for error or experimentation.\n\nTL;DR: removing power progression forces the player to rely purely on mechanical skill and removes the \"grind\" that makes these games addictive. It risks turning a long-term hobby game into a short-term arcade experience.",

So, what are some major \"stress points\" I should try and investigate during this process? Is there anything notable that my plan of attack doesn't cover? I can [link my modlist](https://loadorderlibrary.com/lists/zenith-s-mod-list) for those interested in doing a deeper dive, but that one is a lil out of date (still 95% correct) and I'm at work so I can't access my PC for a few hours.\n\nThank you in advance!",

    "selftext": "TLDR - Paddy beat Chandler who was #5 his whole career (#7 at the time only due to inactivity) and exclusively lost to top 3's in competitive fights so he should be #5 beating him, and he's the most deserving contender to fight Ilia besides Arman. FULL POST - People say \"he beat 38 year old Chandler\", but look at Chandlers whole UFC career: beat #6 in 1 round (becoming #5), lost to #3 (for the belt, Charles became champ off that obviously and he dropped him), lost to #2 in a fight which he gave him adversity, KOTY #7 (washed Ferguson so who really cares), lost to #2 in a fight that was 1-1 going into the 3, then lost to #2 again. Him losing to Paddy is his first loss to someone who isn't #2 or #3. He was #7 when Paddy beat him and the only reason he wasn't #5 was because of inactivity for waiting for Conor for 2 years. So even though it may seem crazy, his ranking with context is him beating Chandler (easier than anyone else who did in the UFC since he basically had no adversity) who always lost to exclusively top 3s. The people below him are Hooker who had a close fight with Gamrot a year until fighting again (destroyed by Arman), and Gamrot who lost to Charles, earlier beat unranked Klein, and earlier lost to Hooker. And like I already said Paddy beat #7. The interim is fine since Ilia needs a mental health break. And I think it should've been Paddy vs Arman, but they hate Arman so it's Gaethje, but Paddy should be in it either way since the options are #1 Arman (should've been instead of Gaethje), #2 Charles and #3 Max (both lost to Ilia already), and #4 Gaethje who is the one he's fighting but is washed and would be his 3rd shot off of Fiziev after already losing to #3 brutally. Paddy vs Arman was the one but either way Gaethje vs Arman makes less sense than Paddy vs Arman so I don't disagree with the Paddy title shot due to the circumstances.",

    "title": "Invisigal and Emotional Immaturity.",
    "selftext": "\nI jumped on the Dispatch train. Was planning to buy if on sale in like 2027 first, then I saw my brother actually had it installed on *his* PS5, and given we have console sharing enabled, this grants me the game entirely for free. I never struck him as interested in these types of games, his interests align more towards what your stereotypical black person might be interested in… or so I thought.\n\nOn an entirely unrelated note: I’ve been strongly re-evaluating my relationship with my entire family and have come across the concept of *Emotional immaturity*. Often associated with Narcissistic personality disorder. \n\nEssentially, when a person is forced to emotionally shut themselves down in life (Often in childhood but it could manifest in adulthood from toxic relationships), or are constantly told they’re not good enough, they slowly lose their sense of self, which results in them either sulking down and accepting it or swerving into the other direction to protect their own dignity. In both cases, they suffer from a preoccupation with themselves, how they’re perceived, how awesome or how messed up they are and all the things they must do to hide their flaws from the outside world. \n\nThey become chameleon people pleasers. Or imposed their rigid, fake selves onto other people and suck the air out the room. In both cases this makes it difficult if not impossible for them to connect with other people, as they truly do not love themselves.\n\nThey cannot change, so they rub people the wrong way, and because they rub people the wrong way, they cannot change…\n\n- - -\n\nI feel like enough has been said about Visi's morals, manipulative tendencies, overall cowardice, her disregard for boundaries, so I’ll zero in on her self loathing:\n\nShe hates herself. It’s evident from her behavior she simply hates what she is. I know this because I, at one point, hated what I was. I saw myself in many of her outbursts, social gaffs, her giddiness when she gets the slightest suggestion someone believes in her potential only for her to lose all hope when it doesn’t work out like a Disney princess movie. \n\nIt strikes me especially that she immediately develops a lust for the first man in her life to believe in her. I admit, anytime a woman is kind to me, no matter what she looks like, she just *becomes* attractive to me. I get an “Aww” from an older woman at my gym and suddenly I like her. I get full attention and eye contact from a chubby co worker after years of side-eyeing fat people because of what I’ve done to get in shape, because I always loathed myself and my body, judging them for what was really a me problem… suddenly I have a fleeting lust for chubbier women? Holy shit. I know they meant nothing by it. It’s a desperate craving for affection that enmeshes itself with every type of relationship.\n\nI’ve personally found that, whenever I try to take responsibility for something horrible I’ve done, I experience flashbacks to various times I was unfairly punished or bullied by family and school staff. The spite, hatred, accusations of “Emotional abuse” directed at a 10 year old boy, it’s all confirmation that they were right about me. I fall into an endless pit of toxic shame. I would do anything to avoid this shame, because of this it’s incredibly difficult for me to change.\n\nInvisibitch is motivated by this pit of toxic shame… *Invisibitch*, it’s much catchier than “Invisigal”, and makes more grammatical sense, but that’s like me discovering. I can fly and calling myself “Invincin**ger”. It’s a scar, evidence of how much she despises herself. But the facade she chooses as “Invisigal” doesn’t fit either. For she does not know what she is. She’s a 27 year old woman pretending to be Robin to anyone’s Batman.\n\nI chose to cut her off because, in my mind, Robert was legally obliged to uphold a policy. I got a bad vibe from her, but I was mostly curious about what would happen when the game was clearly pushing me to forgive and forget. \n\nThe story didn’t give me a valid reason to doubt her integrity until *after* I made the decision to cut her off, not only &gt;!Did she work with Shroud, the man that killed Mecha Man's (Robert’s) father!&lt;, she &gt;!was *still* working with him, the entire reason she was in the SDN was to act as a mole, even though it’s clear she turned on him before the end of episode 8!&lt;. The former being less appalling than the latter, as what she did in the past shouldn’t matter as what she’s doing in the present. \n\nBy episode 8, her demeanor has completely changed. The rejection pushed her further into the pit of shame, making her regress into her previous facade. I didn’t know what kind of person I was dealing with, and as the player, genuinely did not trust her anymore. I couldn’t untie her. Her initial vulgar disregard for boundaries turns into some criminal circus sense of humor of alerting an extremely dangerous, mechanically advanced thug as Robert snuck behind him, why? What kind of joke is that?\n\nConsidering the minority of players (According to choice statistics) that cut her off and allowed her to descend into depravity, I’m shocked to see the number of people online that have hated her from the jump. People complain about the *game* pushing her on you, but I find the other characters didn’t accept any excuses for her behavior, they already don’t like her and are constantly pushing you not to.\n\nThis strikes me as a self fulfilling prophecy. The pit of circular, toxic shame. “My powers are villain powers, people hate me because of what I am, because of this I can never change, because of this I refuse to change, I refuse to change because my powers are villain powers, people hate me because….”\n\nShe would do anything to avoid this shame. Scream, deflect, blame, hide, lie. What else can she do when everyone has already decided who she is? By failing as a mentor, the game accuses you of *neglecting* Visi, which is another way a poor, impressionable child can become emotionally immature or develop some form of narcissism. Shutting off their true selves to become what they think someone else wants them to be. \n\nTo me, the “Bad ending” makes more sense, it’s unrealistic for the belief of one man in a sea of doubt and suspicion from *literally everyone else* would be enough to break her out of that pit of toxic shame,  the chains binding her to her worse self. That is a fantasy. This is how emotionally immature people cope with how they’ve been failed in their formative years and how they remain emotionally immature. \n\nTo change, she must ditch the facade and discover herself, which in the world of labels like \"Hero\" and \"Villain\" based entirely on whoever's sponsoring your activities, she’s simply not equipped to do.\n\n- - -\n\nPost note: (Originally put this a few hours after yesterday’s post) I feel I should mention Coupe/Sonar. I only played once and started by cutting Coupe, so I hope Sonar's story is similar. \n\nThe difference between Coupe and Visi is that she has a properly developed sense of self. Coupe decision to work with the SDN is based entirely on what allowed her to use her skillset and keep a steady stream of income. A lack of heat from the feds is a bonus, but she's doing it primarly for herself. Because she knows what she is and what she wants. Working with the Red Ring allowed her to continue when, as far as she knew, the SDN did not want her. She adapted to her personal circumstances. Because of this I trusted her ability to change as a person, which is why I kept her on the team. \n\nAll I really had to do was press square, not keep a RobertMentorCounter value up, so it was easier. But her actions were a bout of emotional regression following a bureaucratic decision that was not personal. When given a single opportunity, she is able to show emotional maturity and change. Visi, in the worst case, is incapable of change as too many emotional wounds have scabbed and festered in her mind at this point. \n\nI will not pretend this is fair, but from what I know about emotional maturity, this is simply the way it is. Visi was, like many emotionally immature people, failed before she had the ability to fight back. She is a child the village refused to embrace, and because of it she may very well burn it down to feel its warmth.\n\nWe must be gracious to everyone. No matter what.",

Fell even more in love with the series and absolutely played the shit out of it for so many hours, especially with mods.\n\nUnfortunately that laptop got fried, but now at 23 I’ve finally got my first real gaming PC and the first thing I did was redownload Civ 6.\n\nHere’s my question though: I’ve only ever really played those two Civ games.

    "selftext": "**FAQ:**\n\n**Q**: **How can I see all comments made by a user?**  \nA: You cannot see every comment made by a user, but you can backtrack comments made on indexed accounts on [SteamHistory ](https://steamhistory.net/)if you donate them 5€. But it only lasts 30 Days.  \nThrough this feature I'm also obv able to see the comments of other mass shooters, like David Sonboly for example, but this only works if the Steam account hasn't been deleted yet.  \nBrenton Tarrant's Steam account is deleted, that means I can't see if he made some comments.\n\n**Q: Did he know the people he posted those hateful comments under?**  \nA: All hateful comments were said against random people he met in online games.\n\n**Q: Did the Steam users he commented under get other hateful comments, or was Arthur one of the only ones being mean to them?**  \nA: All the people he commented under had dozens of hateful comments similar to Arthur's.\n\n**Q: In which games did he get so mad?**  \nA: Most of them were from Dead by Daylight, but some are also from Counter-Strike 2 / Global Offensive. The last comment from 04.08.2020 might be from Team Fortress 2 if you ignore the exact timestamps, since they are often inaccurate.\n\n**Q:** **Are those now all comments you are able to see with that feature?**  \nA: Yeah, sadly I can’t see any comments he made before August 2020 with that feature, even though I can see on other public and indexed profiles that he commented before 2020. But IMO, those comments wouldn’t be that interesting since they’re so long ago.\n\n**Q: What do those German words he commented mean?**  \nA:  \ndummer = dumb ...  \nhuansohn / hs = son of a bitch  \nbring dich um misset = kill yourself, freak/monstrosity  \nehrenmann = man of honor (slang: “cool guy”)  \nein loyaler Kamerad! = a loyal comrade/mate !  \nköter = mutt",

    "selftext": "https://preview.redd.it/k7g5eqjhq74g1.png?width=3840&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=402d20155ea108eeef9621823d61277512f07fcb\n\nHello it's been a while since the last time i posted on Reddit but the last time was very helpfull so.\n\nMy name is Patcheko, i'm 22 years old and i'm a cinema student living in France. Here is the story behind this illustration\n\n\n\nWhen I was in high school, I wasn’t interested in women at all. I was probably depressed (I probably still am, I’m thinking of getting a diagnosis soon). I hated school and skipped classes a lot. The only thing I cared about was my Xbox. I repeated my first year of high school and failed my final exam. When I left school, I decided to start getting interested in girls because before that, I thought it would “just happen” on its own, but after five years with nobody ever showing romantic interest in me, I figured I might need to force fate a little.\n\nI tried something with a girl in my class, it went badly, and I later learned she was a lesbian. After failing my exam, I didn’t want to redo the year, so I told my mom I wanted to take a year for myself—she obviously took it really badly. This was in 2023. During that year, I was constantly reminded every single day that I was a loser, that I had failed school, and that I was useless in the house. So I started locking myself in my room, and my days became just hanging out on my Discord server and playing Valorant.\n\nAround May, a girl joined the server with her best friend. She was really determined to make friends and get along with everyone. Obviously, my friends didn’t see her that way, so most of them tried to shoot their shot. I didn’t interact much with her because I didn’t believe in online love and didn’t want to be the kind of admin who hits on girls who join the server.\n\nOne day, a friend insisted she join the voice chat, so she did. My friend—let’s call him Harry—eventually went to sleep, and she and I ended up talking all night, and the nights after that too. One morning after an all-nighter, she told me that most of my friends were being ambiguous with her, with screenshots to prove it. Nothing problematic, just cringe messages from guys who were starving. It made me laugh.\n\nAfter that we became closer because I was the only one she felt comfortable with since I wasn’t interested in her. She told me she had also dropped out of school, that her family treated her terribly, and that she drowned her sadness in Valorant too. My “friends” started questioning how much time we spent together. They were jealous because they liked her, without knowing I had the screenshots of their conversations. At first the teasing was funny, but it became increasingly cringe and annoying.\n\nTo mess with them, we made matching profile pictures: Miles Morales for me and Spider-Gwen for her (I am literally Spider-Man btw). They took it horribly, and one of them even texted her saying he was jealous.\n\nMonths went by. We’d be on calls for up to 25 hours sometimes. I spent more time with her than anyone else—she had become my best friend. She said I was her third favorite human, after her brother and her best friend. My “friends,” seeing that, became worse and worse. They made sexual jokes about us and called me a “BDG”—basically a guy who changes his behavior and does anything for women’s attention. They claimed i spent more time than usual in voice chat, which wasn’t true. I was unemployed at the time, so I was always in call even before meeting her.\n\nShe was really affectionate with me. She said I was the perfect man and one of her favorite humans. She once cried because she sent me a picture of her cat to start a conversation, but I was exhausted after an all-nighter and coming home from a birthday party, so I just liked the message, and she thought I didn’t want to talk. One day, when she saw I was feeling down, she wrote a whole paragraph listing everything she appreciated about me, then she said it out loud in voice chat—I don’t even remember why.\n\nHarry, when he heard about it, went into her DMs insisting she write him a paragraph too. She eventually gave in because she wanted to get along with everyone. Did I mention Harry had been in a relationship for a year at that point?\n\nAnd there were other weird behaviors like that. One guy even asked her to tell him about her sex life after learning she and I had talked about sex briefly.\n\nShe eventually didn’t want to go on my server’s voice chat anymore, and I couldn’t stand my “friends.” She begged me not to confront them because she didn’t want drama. So she and I started calling privately.\n\nOne day she told me we had been calling a long time and that I should go hang out with my friends, then suddenly hung up. It happened two or three times. Eventually I asked what was going on. She said it was nothing, but I insisted until she admitted that Harry had messaged her saying he was tired of us always being in private calls and that he “couldn’t voice chat with me anymore because she was hogging me.”\n\nShe begged me not to do anything, but it made me really angry. We’d been friends for months at that point. Then she left for Portugal with her family. She hated her family, and her phone plan didn’t work there. The house was in the countryside, so she could only talk to me when she went into town and connected to public Wi-Fi. She cried about it, so to make her feel better, I gave her my number.\n\nIt was during that period—while she was on vacation—that I developed feelings for her. I told one of my only friends who had never acted weird about her. He told me he once asked her if, had we been in the same city, she would have wanted something to happen between us. According to him, she answered that I wouldn’t have wanted it. So he told her he didn’t care about my answer and wanted to know her answer. She kept saying I wouldn’t have wanted it, without saying yes or no.\n\nOne day I found the courage to tell her, and she said she didn’t feel the same. She gave me a bunch of excuses—saying she wasn’t my type (I had told her I loved everyone but especially Black women), that we lived too far apart (it was only a three-hour bus ride), that her family was racist, etc.\n\nShe started crying and apologizing over and over, and I told her she didn’t need to apologize for not feeling the same. She replied, “You think I don’t feel anything for you?” I clarified that I meant romantic feelings, and she went silent before saying “whatever.” I still think about that moment today.\n\nI told her we needed some distance, and she cried saying she didn’t want to drift apart. I said it would happen sooner or later and that if she ever got into a relationship, I wouldn’t be able to stay. She said that if she ever got a boyfriend and I stopped talking to her, she would break up with him.\n\nAfter that, things became weird. A few weeks later she started ghosting me, then coming back months later, then ghosting again. At the end of April 2024 she came back, then ghosted again. I couldn’t take it anymore. One night I couldn’t stop thinking about her. I drew a portrait of her face. She had often asked me to draw her, but I always told her she had to commission me. When I looked at the drawing, I wanted to give it to her. But I didn’t want it to look like I was trying to guilt-trip her, so I thought I’d call her to clear things up.\n\nA few days later I finally found the courage, but my friends, my nephews and nieces, and all my siblings were at home. So I went to the park downstairs. I tried calling her but she didn’t answer. She eventually texted saying she preferred to talk by text. I told her she usually picked and chose which messages to answer, so I’d rather talk out loud, adding that I wasn’t angry, I just wanted a conversation. After two hours she turned on airplane mode. I went back home wanting to cry, but with everyone around, I held it in.\n\nTen minutes later my mom called me into the living room and told me my grandfather had passed away. I broke down crying in front of everyone—my little brothers, my nephews, my friends—crying like a baby. The stress triggered a painful crisis and I had to go to the ER. I spent my birthday in the hospital.\n\nWe didn’t talk for months, and in December 2024 she came back like nothing had happened. I crashed. I told her how much I suffered and how much I loved her, and begged her to explain why she behaved like that. She told me that a few weeks after we met, she realized she was obsessed with me and only wanted to spend time with me. All her exes had cheated on her, and her parents are terrible examples of a couple. She doesn’t believe in love—she thinks relationships always end—so she kept reminding me out loud that we were friends and that it was platonic, even though I wasn’t interested romantically at the time. She said all those reminders and boundaries were for herself, to kill her feelings before they grew.\n\nShe told me, “Romantic relationships are temporary, and I wanted you with me forever.” She said she was scared. Usually, when she rejects a guy, she doesn’t feel guilty because they don’t take the time to know her—they just idealize her. They only love the parts she shows. But I saw her in every state—happy, sad, angry, tired, depressed…\n\nWhen I told her “I love you,” she stared at her phone and felt something in her chest. She knew I was different, that I loved her completely. It was the first time a man told her he loved her and she believed it. She thinks she’s hard and exhausting to love. But I’ve never felt as loved as when I was her friend, even in the two relationships I had since.\n\nShe distanced herself, and I accepted that whenever she reappeared it was temporary. My two relationships after her lasted 3 and 6 months (including the flirt phase). Today I’m not really in love with her anymore, but there’s a buried feeling inside me, like a last possibility my heart refuses to kill, ready to come back to life if she ever gave me the slightest hint that something could happen.\n\nI know I deserve better now, and I hope I find better. But she’s part of me no matter what. I think of her every time I see my coworkers drink coffee because it’s her favorite drink, or when I see Gwen Stacy (I’m a huge comics fan, especially Spider-Man). I used to keep the same profile pictures for years, but now I change them all the time because when we had matching pfp’s, she always wanted to change them. It was always Miles and Gwen, just a different picture each time. I can’t play Valorant anymore because I associate the game with her, just like I associate Gwen with her.\n\nSometimes I feel like giving up on love, but she showed me how good it feels to be the center of someone’s world, and I would give anything to feel that again.\n\nMy name is Patcheko and I’m an Artist...",

Working for someone else, having people boss me around, following rules that aren’t mine… it just doesn’t feel like the life I’m meant for.\n\nWhat really messes with me is how everyone talks about “accomplishing things” and how they feel useless if they’re not achieving or climbing the ladder. I don’t feel that at all. I don’t care about accomplishments. I don’t want promotions. I don’t want a fancy title. I’m a hard worker, my appraisals are good, but I have zero desire for any of that.\n\nWork just drains me. I go home exhausted, weekends I’m too tired to do anything, and my whole life is work-home-repeat. I dream about having slow mornings, sitting in a coffee shop reading, going out at night without worrying about waking up early. But working feels like it’s sucking the life out of me.\n\nIs it normal that I don’t care about achieving big things? Everyone says they’d feel useless if they didn’t accomplish, and I’m over here feeling nothing. Am I broken or just different?",

I just want God to take me away atp. Haven’t even been able to have a birthday where I’ve been happy in a while to the point that I fear it coming up. I’m just the guy forced to watch everyone be happy while trying to pray over them. I thought that God giving me such a big heart to love was such a good thing but now even that feels like the opposite. In a world full of hate, God made me to love but I can’t take it anymore. I feel discarded, forgotten and maybe even punished by God , because why else would all these years equal pain instead of clarity or some form of blessing. My faith is broken ",

    "selftext": "hallo! \nI haven’t posted in a while lol but I wanted to talk a bit about where I’m at. fyi Self ID: trans masc non binary person (he/they) thanks. \n\nLast episode, I had a hysto (I’m over a year post op now yay!) if def improved things, but mostly it improved my dedication to healing this condition. My vaginismus is psychological for sure, but I am learning what I need to calm my pelvic floor muscles. I have a PVFT appt next week and I’m really hoping they can help cuz every other time I’ve tried to go they couldn’t help me (*due to lack of equipment or scheduling, and the doctor I went to see last doesn’t even work there anymore..)* so I’m trying a PT office that does PVFT. I’m just over feeling this way so I’m biting the bullet instead of trying to do it on my own. \n\nI bought the starter kit for the intimate rose dilator kit because I had the she-ology dilator kit, and it’s .. nice, but smth about it throws me off because it’s so pointy..? I use a ceramic twisted spoon (we listen and we don’t judge lol) as a toy — I realized that the straightness and the cold feelin of the spoon + texture feels really good, it helped my muscles relax during self pleasure and sex. I brought this up to my partner (yay partner!) she’s been really patient, slow and she cheers me on. \n\nLast week I told her I wanted to try one of her fingers. They’re especially thick, but I invited her to try after I got a bit aroused, was super wet and in the zone. The first time she was slowing pushing in, but her nails were too long for my booch so I had to have her pull out, but she told me she was really proud of me and kept cheering me on through it 😭 she did cut her nails the next time, I just didn’t expect them to hurt cuz they weren’t even that long. It felt better when she did cut them but god, her fingers are thick and it would sting/burn when she’d go in. Depth isn’t the issue.. I can go pretty deep once I’m comfortable, and it feels really good to go deeper. But once she started to press against my g-spot it would sting. So I’m learning .. why am I only having pain when she moves? I know I am dryer there so I am trying to be consistent with vaginal cream and vagifem tablets. I’m not consistent but I see I may have to be lol. At least I’ve learned I can get wet pretty good with her around, I’m really happy to know that because I haven’t been that way around anyone. \n\nI want to squeeze her thinking about this. She’s been a huge asset in my healing journey, if I’m hard on myself she will catch me and tell me to be nicer to myself, and be patient. (Ex. “I hate this condition sometimes”) she’s right. \n\nSome things I’ve learned are helping me right now:\n- my partner talking to me through the process\n- the spoon-toy (dw I don’t eat with it that’s why I converted it to a toy lol) \n- Maude aloe based lube - my fav. \n- “foreplay”.. she doesn’t consider it “foreplay” just.. play. which is true, but I need “foreplay” before even my clit can be touched by someone else. Lots of body kissing, teasing, touch, talking, gazing.. etc. we be goin for hours tho it’s great. \n- 1906 “love” arousal pills. These are god send, however I don’t want to rely on them solely eventually. They do help me get out of my head a lot. I take these when I intentionally wanna get intimate w her. \n- self love and patience 🫶🏽 this can’t be skipped. \n\nSome barriers:\n- I can barely take her finger presently and that’s okay, but I did take her entire finger after she went in slow slow slow and she didn’t move unless I told her to. She was very empathetic and gentle the entire time. it stings / burns as if my insides are being scratched esp the first time. \n- I struggle to cum w/ her ); despite being turned on I am too anxious and tense and my muscles tighten to the point I can’t cum, even with a vibrator .. this is one major reason I want to heal this sexually specifically- I don’t mind not being able to do penetration, I’d like to, but presently it feels frustrating sometimes she will do so much to me that feels good and I will be edged for hours 😩 if anyone has a remedy too for this pls lmk lol. We have tried multiple things and the closest I got was when she had her head between my legs from behind lol. \n\nBut I’m glad to have made this progress. ٩(๑❛ᴗ❛๑)۶",

    "title": "[KCD1] Playing my first 15 hours.",
    "selftext": "I'm an old gamer, played a shit ton of games, ranging the entire spectrum. Played many survival games and RPGs. Bought KCD on major sale 2 weeks ago. I had heard about the game from medieval LARP friends who raved about it, so I decided to give it a try. Naturally, I read about the game beforehand and knew the criticism over the fighting scheme. I gotta say, the criticism is well deserved. The problem for me is not the difficulty, as I got by Capon and a few other fights with ease. It's the overall clunkiness and lack of intuitive gameplay. I'm playing on PS5, so my lament is controller based. There are other sword games that are far more user-friendly without being just an easy smash button fest. It's the kind of setup that seems to ignore it's just a controller and would be better served in VR. Yes, i know, the character needs to be leveled up, still the user should make a bigger difference and it does to some degree, but not enough. I don't have a lot of time to dedicate to gaming, so it needs to be at least somewhat fun. The fighting isn't. It's clunky as hell. Both lockpicking and pickpocketing are lame too. Why try to reinvent the wheel only to create a square one?\n\nThing is though, it's not my biggest gripe with the game. The open world is really nice and the story and main characters are great and engaging, but it gets ruined with contrived ambushes that a gamer with only a few hours to spend and wants to avoid fighting, will find irritating AF. It's a game that prides itself on realism, yet you wonder why you see peasants gingerly walking alone, along long empty paths in secluded areas, without a worry in the world, when yourself can't get pass ambushes on a friggin horse. One time, I see three men ahead, about 15 meters upfront, so I go full steam ahead and rush pass them and I'm 10 to 15 meters pass them and my horse rears up to eject me. It's a ridiculous contriviance and irrealistic. A horse would put its own life in danger by doing that. Realistically, if it feels danger and is already galloping at full speed, it just wouldn't stop to rear-up, it would just keep going even faster. It's simply contrived to force you to fight, in a game that's badly set-up to do so in early game. I hate it when game programmers/conceptors put these kind of contrived setups into games.\n\nSince I don't have much time to play, I decided to use fast travel and all 5 times i was ambushed, I used the escape option that says 41% success chance, it failed everytime, on horse, mind you. The latest one made me quit the game. I had my bow equipped and I'm pretty good shot, but was running low on ammo. I also had my sword equipped. There were only two guys. Two guys who could ambush someone on a horse. 41% chance, my ass. All the previous times it failed, I reloaded. This time I tried my hand at it. Got the first guy with a sword easily with my bow, but the second guy was an archer and I had only two arrows left, so unequipped it in the menu because from previous tries, I found the weapon wheel clunky, so my sword and shield would pop when I pressed the in-play equip command. It never got out, so I switched back to the bow. By the time I had put the bow back on and shot the two remaining arrows to put the archer on his knees, sword guy got back to his feet and charged me. Again, couldn't bring up the sword, even though I unequipped the bow in game, then went to menu to unequip it permanently, and made sure my sword and shield were equipped. They never got out. So fucking wonky. It shouldn't be this hard to switch weapons. Not sure I'll go back to it. They make every effort to force you to fight, but are not consequent with making the fighting more user-friendly. It ruins the game for me.",

    "selftext": "Some of its completely physical and disabling and I'm used to it but so much of it affects my chronic mental health problems and just make me feel alone, left out, and just useless. I hate this time of year because of my birthday in January and still being behind on major life markers (I'm about to be 21, I still don't have a driver's license). Lately my chronic problems have been pushing people away and it makes me feel even more alone, like it's just me being left in the dust to struggle. I have chronic back pain (old injury, caused sciatica), rhumetoid arthritis, adhd, autism, a suspected dissociative disorder, and extremely hypermobile joints. \n\nI'm not saying I have it bad (as I do work full-time as a ride operator and am a full-time college student) but I'm tired of having to put myself out so much that I can't manage it on my own and I don't have any support to help me. Most of my problems have finally started getting looked at in the past 4 months and it's made everything worse as well because I'm getting help and answers I need but it's making everything fall apart because I'm trying to keep all these expectations on myself that I had growing up (I had to be the \"perfect only child\") but I'm basically being told to relax a bit and take breaks as needed and I don't know how to because it stresses me even more than just working myself so much I don't have the energy for anything else (which is why most of my personality is overworking and my health, I don't know who I am outside of that). \n\nI don't know what I'm expecting out of posting this but I've lost my last person I could trust with anything about a week ago and have nobody else.",

    "selftext": "I was in college when I met this girl. She was studying in a different state, but from the very beginning, the connection felt real. There was a spark that I had never experienced before. We started dating, and for months everything felt perfect. Both of us would travel to each other’s cities. Even though we came from different cultures and backgrounds, it somehow felt effortless.\nBefore her, I had a lot of casual flings, but she felt like my first true love. My friends often told me, “You can do better,” and many people repeated that same line. It confused and frustrated me because, in my eyes, she was everything. I was madly in love. During my 15-minute college breaks, I would rush home just to see her for even five minutes when she was at my place. Love genuinely makes you crazy.\nLong distance was stressful, but we still managed to complete a year together. After graduating, I thought maybe I should slowly introduce her to my parents. But things went the opposite way, my parents didn’t like her at all. I was put in a very tough position. They told me to end things immediately, and even though I tried explaining why she was special, I eventually lost that battle. I also respect my parents, so I didn’t know what to do.\nEvery day during our video calls, I would be crying from the inside, because I never told her that my parents didn’t approve. I cared too much about her feelings, and I knew it would break her. I even got a job offer in the city where she was studying, but my parents didn’t allow me to go. I joined my family business, and somehow we tried to keep the long-distance going. Not being able to meet her for such a long time was extremely hard on both of us.\nEventually, my parents found out I was still talking to her. That day they were extremely disappointed and again told me to break things off. At that point, it felt impossible to continue. So I started behaving differently with her, not because I wanted to hurt her, but because I didn’t know how to tell her the truth. I didn’t want to say directly that my parents didn’t like her. My “bad boyfriend” behaviour went on for months. She begged me to change, but I felt helpless. I cried every night during that phase.\nIn the end, she left without saying anything. Her last text was, “I hate you.” The real pain is that she doesn’t know the truth. She actually thinks I’m a bad person. After that relationship, I haven’t been able to be with anyone, because nothing feels the same.\nA month later she called me, only to say she was dating someone eight years older, and she ended the call by cussing me. From that day onwards, I’ve felt numb. Heartless. Like something inside me shut down completely.\n",

    "selftext": "I was just diagnosed on Wednesday (no cataplexy) after having symptoms for as long as I can remember and having an MSLT sleep study and overnight study. I feel a huge sense of relief to have a doctor that knows way more than I do. I genuinely gaslit myself into thinking it was IH or nothing and not narcolepsy. \n\nAnyways, I’m in nursing school and I’ve been dealing with the worst fatigue and exhaustion. I typically sleep 9 hours at night and take 1 or 2 naps a day, which are about 1-2 hours long each. And usually that’s with a bit of caffeine (I have POTS as well, so just as much as I can tolerate) and with 50mg of modafinil at times (also needed a low dose because of POTS) for the last few months. It’s been exhausting to be working full time and doing school full time while also incorporating daily naps. \n\nI also get insane dreams. I’ve experienced several lucid dreams where I’ve had full control and been able to fly and perform actions all on my own. I have also always had extremely vivid and frequent dreams, which my family and friends always commented on how abnormally vivid and frequent they are. I also experience sleep paralysis with hallucinations (can’t remember the word for it). This is terrifying and I wouldn’t wish it on anyone. \n\nI want to put in a quick rant paragraph here also about how hard it’s been to keep relationships as well. I had an ex of 2.5 years who left me for several reasons, but he hated the fact that I took naps every day and seemed to think it was because of laziness. I grew to hate this about myself. I made it a goal to not take naps and it ended up doing way more harm than good because I couldn’t physically stay awake and I was more of a danger to myself. \n\nFinding out that it’s a true medical condition and not just laziness or in my head has been life changing for my mental and physical health already. My doctor switched me to Sunosi the other day and I’m starting day 3 and I’ve gone 2 days without needing any naps! I know I just started it, but this is the first time in YEARS where I’ve gone an entire day without even THINKING about sleep. I studied for 7.5 hours yesterday and told myself I could nap if I needed to, but I didn’t even think about it!! And I start my first clinical rotations this week and I’m hoping and praying that this medication is just as effective then as well. \n\nI’m finally seeing a glimmer of hope and I’m also so glad I found a community to rant to and find common experiences with. Thanks for having me :) ",

And abusive?\n\n\"engaging in or characterized by habitual violence and cruelty.\"\n\nHmm, that's odd. Carmine doesn't fit those requirements.\n\n'Oh but what about how rude she is with him?'\n\nHave you **seen** how siblings behave? That's normal. (Source: I have a sibling.)\n\n'She didn't want to tell him about Ogerponnnnn-\"\n\nMy fellow Kieran fan. It was the middle of the night, he was in fucking festival sandles, AND she didn't know what Ogerpon was like until the next morning! You really think the character who's described as being \"overprotective\" is going to let her brother go follow the Ogre WHO KILLED THEIR TOWN'S HEROES AND STEALS SOULS?!\n\n'B-But Ogerpon didn't do-!'\n\nAgain, she **didn't know** that yet! Its very heavily implied that she was going to tell Kieran about Ogerpon later, but then their grandpa told them to keep up the lie because he didn't think Kieran was ready for it yet. Direct quote: \"Now I REALLY can't tell Kiki we met the ogre...\"\n\n'She implies she hits him!'\n\nOh yeah, cause the writer's would totally just have that be mentioned in ONE LINE and never bring it up again. Hell, even his behavior doesn't suggest that she hits him. He never cowers in fear of her, he even says this at one point: \"I know my sis seems kinda harsh, b-but she's really not all that bad...\"\n\nAnd before you say he's defending her out of fear, she's not present when he says this. \n\nNow, what other moments are there where she \"abuses\" or \"bullies\" Kieran?\n\nNone. There are none.\n\nNeed I remind you that Carmine was the one who encouraged us to befriend Kieran because he was too shy to ask us himself?\n\nTo be honest, when I first started writing this, I had a whole ass paragraph in mind of how some Kieran fans behave, how its possible to \"defend Kieran\" without bashing on Carmine. You don't need one to do the other. And to be honest? That sort of thing is why Kieran defenders have left such a bad taste in people's mouth, some of us can be so obnoxious about \"Kieran good, Carmine bad\" that we're just making people hate on us and the character we like.\n\nIt's possible to like both characters, its possible to see they both have flaws, but that's what makes them interesting! Without flaws, there'd be no fans, no love, no hate, nothing but their designs would have them stand out.",

    "title": "Post-Separation Abuse. Systemic Failures.",
    "selftext": "\\#16DaysOfActivism\n\n[Video created by NotebookLM based on the book by Loren Keeling, Post Separation Abuse, and other research. ](https://reddit.com/link/1p9rahc/video/2rd97t56p74g1/player)\n\nFive years ago, I started a blog, LifeChangePlans. I was on a mission of discovery.\n\nAfter 11 years in a relationship with a man I had trusted deeply, I was betrayed and abandoned in Spain. The property that he had declared was our first home together. I had no idea that I was \"economically vulnerable\" or that I was being manipulated in that relationship that was not a relationship, according to the ex-person. I know now that it was not a relationship because it was a fake, false, manipulationship.\n\n  \nThe post-separation abuse that I experienced was a continuation of the abuse that was already present, only I did not understand. When I was left alone in Spain while searching for answers and searching for myself, questioning, \"Who am I?\" I found educational resources online, videos, articles, research, and books. I was an avid consumer of all these different materials. For eight months, I was in shock and grief, fear and uncertainty. I had no idea if I would live or die; that might sound extreme, but it was touch-and-go at times of the most extreme distress. Calling a neighbour when I received an email that tipped me over the edge. Driving the 10-minute drive to her house with tears streaming down my face because I could not trust myself to be alone. This is what emotional and psychological abuse does to a person.\n\n[WomensAid](https://womensaid.org.uk/information-support/what-is-domestic-abuse/domestic-abuse-is-a-gendered-crime/)\n\n&gt;QUOTE: \"Every case of domestic abuse should be taken seriously and each individual given access to the support they need.\"\n\nAlso, this QUOTE:\n\n**The United Nations defines gender-based violence in the following way:**\n\n&gt;“The definition of discrimination includes gender-based violence, that is, violence that is directed against a woman because she is a woman or that affects women disproportionately. It includes acts that inflict physical, mental or sexual harm or suffering, threats of such acts, coercion and other deprivations of liberty.”**(CEDAW 1992: para. 6)**\n\nFor five years, I have tried to get support and help. For five years, that help did not arrive. It started when I tried to contact UK Domestic Abuse Organisations. - No help there. They can only help with cases in England and Wales because that is the funding remit.\n\nThe Spanish legal advice did not help me, the 016 gender violence helpline gave me advice before going to file a GV complaint, to have a solicitor. My request for a solicitor in the Guardia Civil was ignored. The GV organisation CAVI also did not help me; they gave me advice to \"negotiate\" without legal representation, which proved to be impossible. However, I did obtain a handwritten agreement for £40,000 in July 2021, when there was a potential buyer for the property. I signed that agreement while I knew he had instructed a new lawyer in Barcelona, I knew because the ex-person made sure he copied his email to the mediation company to our joint email account, and I had discovered it. \n\nCross-border legal firms. Could not help me. I was quoted £5000 by one firm; they admitted they had never listened to the recorded evidence I had sent to them. As a non-confrontational personality, still in shock, I was unable to give an opinion or a response. Maybe this: \"I‘m sorry, how can you quote a fee when you have not considered the evidence of my situation?\"\n\nWhen the GV complaint was dismissed in January 2021, I had hired a Mediation Company. Again, no help; in fact, they turned out to be incompetent and fraudulent, and I reported them to Actionfraud with three other individuals who were also scammed out of fees. \n\nI started writing about my lived experience in April 2021. This seemed to be the only way to protect myself. To publish the truth of my experience being in a situation of abuse that I had not understood as abuse until the termination or #discard happened. This was the beginning of five years of post-separation abuse, where the perpetrator was allowed to take Civil and Criminal actions against me, spending thousands of pounds on cross-border litigation between the UK and Spain. \n\n\n\nThe criminal defamation against me and six other criminal allegations with maximum penalties requested by his expensive Barcelona Lawyer. A clear case of DARVO: deny abuse, attack the victim, reverse the victim and the offender, now I was the accused. The investigations dragged on for two years. Eventually, all of the criminal allegations were dismissed in October 2024, a partial victory. \n\nThe Civil Court in Cartagena, Murcia, Spain, attempted to evict me twice during 2024, the last date was December 19th, and that date was suspended two days before what the solicitor referred to as \"the launch\", where the police would attend to help me. \n\nI'm still without any legal representation. Struggling financially because, according to the Spanish Women's Court, I am not a victim or survivor of gender based violence. Therefore, I did not qualify for support or assistance. One court official told me outright, in this country, it is innocent until proven guilty. Suggesting that I had made a grave error in my decision to publish my story, because the other party had not been prosecuted. Laugh, I could have cried. That was exactly the reason I published my story in the first place: to highlight the failings and the gaps in the laws. \n\n\n\nDo you know that under the 1/2004 comprehensive measures on violence against women, Spanish nationals are covered under the laws even if they reside in any other country? Yet, GREVIO has reported on the difficulties that foreign women or migrants face when they experience gender violence. \n\nA SLAPP lawsuit against an ex-partner can be considered a form of gender violence, particularly when it is used to silence, intimidate, or re-victimise them, which is a common tactic in gender-based violence. While SLAPP suits are distinct from domestic violence in their legal definition, using them against survivors can serve the same purpose of control and abuse, exploiting the legal system to re-traumatise and silence survivors. Something which the Spanish legal professionals ignored until I discovered the EU CASE report for defamation cases in Spain between 2022/23. Thank god my intuition told me to download and read that report. \n\nThis website [Blue Print For Free Speech](https://www.blueprintforfreespeech.net/en/news/when-the-law-silences-survivors-slapps-and-gender-based-violence) has more information.\n\n  \nThe only UK Charity that has provided support is [SEA Surviving Economic Abuse](https://survivingeconomicabuse.org/), as I became a volunteer and sat in on various meetings. \n\nLifeChangePlans - created by a survivor who dared to publish her story as a creative non-fiction under the pen name Loren Keeling.

    "title": "What's up with the IMCWP/Solidnet?",
    "selftext": "The International Meeting of Communist and Workers' Parties (or Solidnet) is a political international first founded in 1998 in Greece. Its membership is made up of 124 different communist and labour parties from around the world. Many of these parties, though, can notably be quite reformist, revisionist, and even outright reactionary. For example:\n\n- Communist Party of Greece: The founding party of the IMCWP, the KKE (and three minor far-right parties) voted against the legalization of same-sex marriage in 2024. They have also long opposed same-sex civil unions and the legalization of soft drugs.\n\n- Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia: The KSČM is a nativist and anti-Muslim political party in the Czech Republic. The majority of KSČM MPs are opposed to same-sex marriage and many of its members are openly part of the far-right. The KSČM does not consider gender equality to be a policy aim and voted against the country's Anti-Discrimination Act. They also argue that immigrants take advantage of Czech social services and their slogans include ‘Stop illegal migration’ and 'No more green delirium’. Several of their candidates were found spreading disinformation during the COVID-19 pandemic and, since 2023, they've been in an electoral alliance with various nationalist and conservative political parties. The party opposes taking in Palestinian refugees, claiming that \"radical Islamists who are in Palestine could target us.\"\n\n- Portuguese Communist Party: The PCP has long abstained from voting on LGBTQ+ issues such as adoption rights for same-sex couples, cohabitation laws, and the condemnation of homophobic persecution in Chechnya. The party was also criticized for expelling gay couples from its Avante! Festival in 2022, with party guards warning that \"there are no f****t comrades.\"\n\n- Party of Communists of the Republic of Moldova: In 2011, the PCRM opposed the government's official recognition and registration of Moldova's Muslim community. Party president Vladimir Voronin stated that \"To register [them] two weeks before Easter, which is our biggest Orthodox holiday, to register a faith that is the exact opposite of our own Orthodox religion -- this is more than strange.\" Also, in 2021, Voronin asked, on live TV, \"Is this what you want, dear voters, when you vote for parliament? Do you want them to vote [...] for NATO soldiers to come here and for you to have children with dark skin, not just white skin? Is this what you want?\" Furthermore, in 2018, the party helped host a gathering of conservative and anti-gay Christian groups called the World Congress of Families and, in response to an anti-discrimination law, in 2012, the party also called for an 'anti-homosexual' referendum.\n\n- Communist Party of the Russian Federation: Since 2010, the CPRF has been in an informal alliance with various Russian nationalist, national conservative, right-wing populist, socially conservative, and monarchist parties including the far-right antisemitic, ultranationalist People's Militia of Kvachkov. The CPRF (the second-largest political party in the country) is also part of Russia's \"systemic opposition\": groups which, while claiming to be in opposition, rarely oppose the government's policies. For example, in 2013, the CPRF voted in favour of the Russian Anti-LGBT Law (condemned by the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child, Amnesty International, and Human Rights Watch). This law led to a notable increase of homophobic violence in Russia.\n\n- Communist Party of Britain: During the 2024 United Kingdom general election, J. K. Rowling endorsed the party for its views on transgender issues. Enough said.\n\nAnd these are just a few. This international contains some of the largest and most well-known communist parties on Earth: The Communist Party of Canada, the Communist Party of Vietnam, the Communist Party of Cuba, the CPUSA, the South African Communist Party, the Tudeh Party of Iran, etc. Why is this tolerated? Why aren't these criticized? How do more progressive and revolutionary parties stay in an international where the rights of queer and trans people, people of colour, immigrants, and women are seemingly negotiable and where actively aiding in upholding (or entirely reestablishing) capitalism is permitted?\n\nI'm not trying to be sectarian here. I'm honestly just confused. No hate intended to good comrades in Greece, Portugal, Russia, and the rest.",

    "selftext": "End of statement, no ifs or buts, it is a fact and I'm tried of pretending it's not.\n\nLet's look at the definition of abuse, shall we?\n\n\"treat (a person or an animal) with cruelty or violence, especially regularly or repeatedly.\"\n\nHmm, interesting. And abusive?\n\n\"engaging in or characterized by habitual violence and cruelty.\"\n\nHmm, that's odd. Carmine doesn't fit those requirements.\n\n'Oh but what about how rude she is with him?'\n\nHave you **seen** how siblings behave? That's normal. (Source: I have a sibling.)\n\n'She didn't want to tell him about Ogerponnnnn-\"\n\nMy fellow Kieran fan. It was the middle of the night, he was in fucking festival sandles, AND she didn't know what Ogerpon was like until the next morning! You really think the character who's described as being \"overprotective\" is going to let her brother go follow the Ogre WHO KILLED THEIR TOWN'S HEROES AND STEALS SOULS?!\n\n'B-But Ogerpon didn't do-!'\n\nAgain, she **didn't know** that yet! Its very heavily implied that she was going to tell Kieran about Ogerpon later, but then their grandpa told them to keep up the lie because he didn't think Kieran was ready for it yet. Direct quote: \"Now I REALLY can't tell Kiki we met the ogre...\"\n\n'She implies she hits him!'\n\nOh yeah, cause the writer's would totally just have that be mentioned in ONE LINE and never bring it up again. Hell, even his behavior doesn't suggest that she hits him. He never cowers in fear of her, he even says this at one point: \"I know my sis seems kinda harsh, b-but she's really not all that bad...\"\n\nAnd before you say he's defending her out of fear, she's not present when he says this. \n\nNow, what other moments are there where she \"abuses\" or \"bullies\" Kieran?\n\nNone. There are none.\n\nNeed I remind you that Carmine was the one who encouraged us to befriend Kieran because he was too shy to ask us himself?\n\nTo be honest, when I first started writing this, I had a whole ass paragraph in mind of how some Kieran fans behave, how its possible to \"defend Kieran\" without bashing on Carmine. You don't need one to do the other. And to be honest? That sort of thing is why Kieran defenders have left such a bad taste in people's mouth, some of us can be so obnoxious about \"Kieran good, Carmine bad\" that we're just making people hate on us and the character we like.\n\nIt's possible to like both characters, its possible to see they both have flaws, but that's what makes them interesting! Without flaws, there'd be no fans, no love, no hate, nothing but their designs would have them stand out.",

    "title": "Understanding NHI Behaviour - Explaining why historical evidence and whistle-blower leaks suggest NHI are NOT interested in exterminating Humanity! Analysis of what may change in NHI behaviour towards Humanity in the near-term. Finally, how/why human behaviour needs to develop to be accepted by NHI!",
    "selftext": "Get ready, this is a very long, but hopefully useful, article to help make better sense of the NHI behaviours we see today, and what they are doing on Earth. (Written without AI/LLMs)\n\nThis article was triggered by Age of Disclosure. So glad Stratton went public. He, amongst others, has the background,  experience, credibility and public voice to convince mainstream society. So, now it has been established that NHI are definitely here, and of multiple species. How do we make sense of what's happening with eyewitnesses, contactees, abductees, craft around military and civilian locations, etc, and understand their confusing and unpredictable behaviours? Also, what might happen going forwards in the months and years ahead??\n\nLet's start with the **number one fear** many people have, particularly those who have just become aware of UAP and NHI visitors are real. Firstly, **NONE of the civilisations visiting Earth are particularly hostile, otherwise we would not be having this conversation! NHI are anything up to millions of years more advanced than Humanity, and their technology is like magic to us. We would have no chance if one civilisation chose to exterminate our species. So it's not worth worrying about!**\n\nOn to the hard ro understand NHI behaviour. There appears to be a combination of historical reasons for NHI behaviour. \\[But invasion, and extermination, is not one of them!\\] There are also recent, newly exposed reasons, why NHI might  increase their involvement more directly in our near future. Plus, certain aspects of humanity influence how NHI approach dealing with humans and our civilisation. Together, these various reasons are identified here as **key behavioural drivers** that are responsible for much what humans experience directly, or through eyewitness accounts regarding UAP and NHI encounters. \n\n**NHI Behavioural Drivers** \n\n1. **Nuclear technologies**: NHI became aware of our breakthrough in nuclear technologies in the 1940s. This triggered an ongoing monitoring exercise to track our scientific and military development, particularly any nuclear systems. This has not stopped.  There are constant new stories of craft entering restricted areas related to nuclear technology e.g. diamond shaped craft at Pantex nuclear weapons plant recently.\n\nSheehan stated in the past 12 months that they see humanity as a threat \"to the life giving capacity of our planet\", and NHI have indicated that they would intervene if the threat of nuclear conflict and holocaust came close to being triggered. Intervention in order to save the planetary ecosystem,  and not our species specifically.  That intervention would be public a type of visible disclosure where national governments would be forced by NHI to destroy nuclear weapons capabilities.\n\nTherefore constant monitoring of all nuclear related technologies and assets is an important activity for NHI. Both military and civilian domains. Involving visiting and scanning assets, interacting with certain systems, demonstrating superiority and control over human technology, tracking and sometimes blocking risky movements or deployments of nuclear weapons, intervention where there is an uncontrolled nuclear danger e.g. Fukushima, UAPs were witnessed and said to have taken action to prevent reactor meltdown when human intervention was not yet available or effective. \n\n2. **Research** **Studies**: There is clear evidence of NHI scientific  study of humans, along with other forms of life e.g. animals, plants, etc. NHI have been witnessed many times seemly taking plant/soil samples in various locations, abducting animals and humans. Performing tests, health examinations, procedures and ongoing monitoring of abductees. Monitoring development of human families over generations.\n\nAnimal mutilations e.g. cattle, sheep, horses,  pigs, deer, elk, wild animals,   appear to be scientific  sampling of key organs and sensory systems for scientific study. Comparing the same biological samples between species and their evolution over time. \n\n3. **Genetic engineering** of babies to create **human/NHI hybrid beings**. Human/NHI hybrids using sperm and ova taken from abductees. Implanted eggs, removal of embryos, contact with hybrid children, nursery care, using abductees to help develop the hybrid children or teach human behaviours. \n\nAlso, potentially **human DNA genetic engineering** to influence our biological development. Could have started 240,000 years ago to create Homosapiens, and possibly more recent points through history. It may be a continuous experiment with abductees receiving gene editing. We don't really have strong evidence but there are anomalies and reported insider discussions around this topic. If any or all of this is true, then that explains a strong reason for NHI direct interest in humans, and their continued presence on Earth. \n\nReturning to hybrids, creating them seems unlikely for the \"invasion of Earth\" by introducing hybrids into the population. Genetic engineering and breeding hybrids was reported by abductees back in the 70s, 80s and later. However, after c50 years, there is almost no sign of hybrids in human society. So either the invasion has failed or it wasn't an invasion at all. Today, it's unclear how much hybrid experimentation continues. \n\nIf you think of all the people who you have ever met,  how many might have  been hybrid. For me, zero out of thousands I have met over the years. So, even if 100,000 or even more hybrids have been created since the 1980s, there are now 8bn humans today. Meaning a tiny fraction of 1% would be hybrids, with no apparent overt threat to humanity, and human population far outstripping extremely small numbers of hybrids. There is no evidence of hybrid invasion and it would take hundreds of years to artificially generate large numbers that could somehow replace standard humans. And then, the NHI wouldn't be invading but it would be our joint children? Is that invasion? Why do that at all? \n\nAlthough, hybrid creation is real and everything supporting that experimental process is responsible for many varied NHI activities and eyewitness accounts across decades.\n\nIt's only the **hybrid** **invasion narrative doesn't make sense**, I don't see the evidence or support from key insiders who should know, and hence feel hybrids are a distraction/conspiracy theory. If anything, I believe hybrids were created and taken to other star systems to establish on different planets. I don't see any credible evidence for hybrids in our society in any significant numbers. I've only heard a handful of eyewitness accounts of encounters with potential grown hybrids, in a few settings e.g. shop, church. Some of which may have been pure NHI beings, and not hybrid at all.\n\n4. **PRIME DIRECTIVE**: NHI appear to follow a \"prime directive\" style of non-interference in human development and society. They remain mostly covert, camouflaging/hiding their craft, and show themselves by choice to specific individuals, in specific places. They don't let this policy prevent contact when it suits their purposes e.g. abductions for study, monitoring and manipulation of nuclear weapons, demonstrations of technical superiority, etc. That explains the sporadic, random nature of contact to suit their agenda. It also explains why abductees have their memories tampered with to preserve a level of covert secrecy until open contact with Humanity is established.\n\nThis leads to a small number of humans knowing NHI are real, but society overall unware due to lack of transparency and government disclosure. This leads to a disconnect, extreme differences in world views, lack of support for those who experience trauma or PTSD as a result of contact, when they should be treated with standard clinical care and believed. This disconnect will continue, along with health and wellbeing issues, until formal Government disclosure makes the facts available for institutions, science, medicine, education,  businesses, etc to accept and integrate into our learning, our technology development, our products and services, etc. NHI civilisations, their benefits to humanity, then becomes part of our daily lives and  another openly discussed, accepted part of our society. \n\n5. **Environmental Destruction**: NHI have repeatedly warned contactees over decades about humanity's negative affect on the environment and destruction of nature and threat of global warming e.g. Ariel school children \n\nNHI have indicated via the Legacy Program (source Sheehan) that they may need to intervene to prevent the \"destruction of the life giving capacity of our planet\", as per point 1.\n\nAgain, intervention is not removal of humanity but taking the action required to protect the planet. Overtly over-riding national governments to, for example, stop all fossil fuel use and substitute renewable sources. So be prepared should this actually happen. \n\n6. **Human Aggression**: NHI appear to be threatened by the potential for humanity to develop interstellar technologies by reverse engineering UAPs, and begin exploring. Resulting in the likely export of human aggression and possiblle nuclear threat to their home planets. \n\nUntil we learn to live constructively and peacefully as one species, putting war aside and using resources to help Humanity progress and develop faster such that wars and poverty are no longer acceptable,  or until no one has the incentive to create armed conflict since life is too enjoyable and interesting. Until then, we will continue our aggression and the need for power and dominance over others, even as we visit other star systems. **Our** **continued**  **aggression is a threat and risk the NHI need to manage. It is also a hurdle Humanity must overcome, to engage successfully with NHI civilisations.** \n\n**Our single planet competition for territory and resources, is a mindset and behaviour which needs to be changed to allow Humanity to engage with NHI civilisations**. Otherwise, NHI might prevent us from expanding outside our solar system, until we have full control of our aggression or have genetically engineered out aggressive mental disorders e.g. psychopaths, sociopaths, sadists, etc, which today are the source of the majority of wars, death and destruction led by mentally ill authoritarians, Dictators and terrorist groups. \n\nHence **NHI monitor our technical advancement** or evolution in aerospace, advanced technology, energy, weapons, our behaviour,  our conflicts, etc. Some benevolent species may be trying to guide us on the right path to a better society, such that  Humanity eventually will be allowed to engage with other NHI civilisations openly without being perceived as an unacceptable threat e.g. Tall Whites, Nordics may be helping. \n\nNote that NHI do not intervene and prevent millions of humans dying in horrific conflicts or internal genocides. They watched thousands of nuclear tests. Watched Japan being nuked. They will not step in and prevent Humanity from destroying itself. Don't expect to be saved by NHI, except through individual good deeds that are sometimes reported by abductees healed of serious medical conditions.  They will save our planet above saving the human species, so saving Humanity may be a happy side effect of NHI preventing some other catastrophe. \n\n7. **Psionic abilities**: However, **there is a possible new path to dealing with human tendencies towarda violence or abuse. Developing our \"psionic\" abilities is one area that could help,** since using abilities **such as remote viewing, precognition, telepathy, etc**, partly relies on making a positive, and sometimes needs a loving/emotional, connection to make use of those abilities. Remote viewing can help sense wrong doing before it happens. E.g. you see a firearm being prepared when remote viewing someone you mistrust. Precognition can give warnings of negative events which might occur, and there are clear cases where outcomes can be influenced e.g. driving a different route home to avoid a predicted robbery at a particular road junction. Telepathy can expose malicious thoughts, feelings and intent that may be leak out unintentionally, despite the source attempting to suppress revealing those intentions. \n\nThese new psionic abilities are only fairly recently accepted as real publically, are now increasingly proven effective in controlled tests and today are actively used by certain skilled people as part of their day to day lives or even part of their work. **Psionic abilities together reduce the potential for bad actors to carry out malicious actions, and would make it difficult to remain anonymous in human society,  if psionic skills were regularly used by a majority of society** with the inherited abilities. E.g. If you can detect bad intent through remote sensing, viewing, precognition or someone's personal energy aura, you can more easily and rapidly identify those humans who are wired as bad actors and who need to be removed from society or marginalised, and certainly kept from power, influence and violence. If you make a telepathic connection with someone then they expose their thoughts and emotions, then aggressive, violent, abusive people will not be able to disguise who they really are. This would lead to identifying bad actors, abusers, violent criminals and psychopaths. Which society would need to find new ways to remove from such malignant threats for the greater good. \n\nTo progress along a path that could be a solution to reducing aggression and abuse in society, Humanity should research psionics and teach everyone at school age how to access their inate abilities, to use them effectively and to train and strengthen them. Perhaps there are genetic manipulations that could be discovered which increase access and effectiveness of psionic abilities in all individuals (only a to be researched proportion of humanity has useable psionic abilities, even after training. Perhaps 30-40% can effectively perform remote viewing, once taught how to use it)\n\nMost, if not all NHI visitors use telepathic communication. That, plus other psionic abilities, may be the key to becoming a non-aggressive  Galactic civilisation, rather than remaining a single planet civilisation. **In my opinion, NHI would be totally justified in keeping Humanity at arms length, until such time that our unacceptable and dangerous parts of human behaviour, have been minimised or somehow removed from the gene pool.**\n\nThis is one area I believe **NHI might be wiliing to help with. Perhaps accelerating our access to strong psi abilities. Teaching us new** **methods, bio-engineering or technologies that can address human aggression and abuse. In is in their interests to change our society and human behaviour to achieve acceptable levels of trust in future**. They may even prefer to intervene,  to accelerate our development into a better, much less violent and abusive society.  In turn, less of a threat to other species. Which I believe would eventually enable humanity to engage with other advanced civilisations in our galaxy in a non-threatening manner, behaviourally acceptable to advanced NHI civilisations. 🛸👽\n\n\\---- \n\nThose are the drivers which together help explain most NHI behaviour, news stories, eyewitness accounts, etc And, they also set expectations for what we may see NHI doing next, and in the not too distant future. \n\n**Conclusion** \n\n**NHI are not interested in taking our planet or exterminating Humanity**. The fact we are still here after thousands of years, when NHI were likely here 12-14,000 years ago from many examples of archaeological evidence indicating advanced technology used before the Egyptians, across the world. More advanced than we have today. At that time, NHI could have wiped out Humanity when we were numbering in the millions, not billions. But they didn't.\n\n**Advanced NHI civilisations can take any unoccupied planet light years from Earth, and occupy an unpolluted, stable ecosystem, without 8bn intelligent, unpredictable and aggressive monkeys. Earth is a terrible candidate for occupation and so our human ego needs to stop thinking Earth is the best planet in the universe,**  which every NHI must want to possess. That's \"single planet\" thinking. Galactic thinking dictates you select the best suited, most stable, easiest to colonise, planet for your needs, selected from thousands, if not millions, within reasonable travel and logistics constraints. It's laughable that humans still fear invasion of Earth  given the vast numbers of options and potential even we know is out there. \n\n**The implication of drivers 1 and 5 above, is NHI would appear publically, no longer covert and take actions which are hard to predict.  Humanity would experience catastrophic disclosure, if they had not been warned or made aware of NHI beforehand** and the risk of NHI  intervention as described  above. **However**,  \"**intervention\" is still not \"invasion\".**\n\nThese potential interventions have been given as one of the key reasons why we need formal Disclosure by governments ASAP. Because we are only moving closer to a possible nuclear conflict (even by accident), as the risks keep rising with Russia and Iran.  Plus, global warming is out of control and is now worsening every year,  and our global efforts to decarbonise are too slow. So again we are moving closer to destruction of large parts of our Ecosystem.  And therefore closer to NHI intervention. \n\nThat is unless we act swiftly on nuclear escalation and risks. Also, unless we accelerate renewable energy deployment rapidly and globally to replace oil and gas. But are either are likely at happen any time soon? \n\n**I personally would welcome NHI intervention at this point, because I don't believe we have the strength of leadership to avoid either of the above risks turning into an accidental apocalypse of our own creation.** So hopefully we'll be much more aware of NHI soon, either first by government announcement e.g. Trump disclosure? Or by our galactic neighbours showing up and taking the nuclear toys away, etc. 😅\n\n**Roll on Disclosure**!!! 🖖🏼🛸👽\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nNo TL:DR this time, but welcome any constructive comments, considered feedback and any significant NHI behavioural drivers I may have missed.",

    "selftext": "Some background: I made this test for a discord bot in the style of IDRLabs personality tests, but besides the entertainment factor of the test, there's not much else I can do with it. The Character Architecture Assessment could, theoretically, be used to develop characters for new fictional stories, or analyze existing characters for deeper understanding. \n\n  \nAs an example of using it for the analysis of existing characters, I decided to try the test on Dean Winchester from Supernatural. Here's how Claude scored him (I have individual answers also):\n\n* **Drive: 10/10**\n* **Social Warmth: 5/10**\n* **Emotional Stability: 4/10**\n* **Material Orientation: 1/10**\n* **Conflict Orientation: 8/10**\n* **Empathic Sensitivity: 9/10**\n* **Impulse Control: 2/10**\n* **Worldview: 3/10**\n* **Courage: 9/10**\n\nThese scores may not be perfect, but the goal is to get close enough. With a character like Dean in particular, he was written by multiple people and taken in different directions, so he may be different season-to-season along with across the show as a whole. Maybe you can use that as an example of what happens without a clear understanding of your character, in which this test aims to assist. \n\n  \nI can't attach the .md or .pdf so i'll paste the markdown below, and there's a link to an interactive version of the test at the bottom (if you don't mind using an ai-created adaptation of the test).\n\n\\# Character Architecture Assessment 9 (CAA-9)\n\n\n\n\\*\\*A 45-point assessment across 9 dimensions for understanding core character traits\\*\\*\n\n\n\n\\---\n\n\n\n\\## Instructions\n\n\n\nFor each statement below, select the response that best describes you or your character:\n\n\\- \\*\\*Strongly Disagree\\*\\*\n\n\\- \\*\\*Slightly Disagree\\*\\*\n\n\\- \\*\\*Neutral/NA\\*\\*\n\n\\- \\*\\*Slightly Agree\\*\\*\n\n\\- \\*\\*Strongly Agree\\*\\*\n\n\n\n\\---\n\n\n\n\\## Questions\n\n\n\n1.

    "selftext": "u/Eudowujin, u/Sharpest_Edge84, u/Fight_Satan, u/DangerDaveo\n\nConcerning the issue of homosexuality, I studied the issue from [different perspectives](https://www.reddit.com/r/BibleVerseCommentary/comments/swc6jt/homosexual_acts_are_sinful/) and arrived at my conclusion. \nI think homosexual intercourse is a sin, and I do not support the practice of it. I think each believer should follow his conscience in answering this question. Let God's peace guide you. \n\nWill practicing lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people go to hell?\n\nSome will. God judges everyone individually. Not everyone who calls himself a Christian has eternal life. I leave the eternal judgment to God and live in peace with God, myself, and everyone else. Why take chances? Click [this](https://new.reddit.com/r/BibleVerseCommentary/comments/s31yff/what_does_it_mean_to_be_born_again/).\n\nConcerning the issue of transgender, is it a sin?\n\nI think so. We are called to glorify God in our lives. We all sin daily.\n\nWill I attend a gay wedding?\n\nI may, but probably not. In God's eyes, marriage is between a man and a woman. Attending a wedding means that I witness and endorse the marriage. I would ask God's guidance on a case-by-case basis.\n\n1Co 5:\n&gt;9 I wrote to you in my letter not to associate with sexually immoral people— 10 not at all meaning the sexually immoral of this **world**, or the greedy and swindlers, or idolaters, since then you would need to go out of the world. \n\nAccording to Paul, it was okay to associate with immoral people who were not believers.\n\n&gt;11 But now I am writing to you not to associate with anyone who bears the name of **brother** if he is guilty of sexual immorality or greed, or is an idolater, reviler, drunkard, or swindler—not even to **eat** with such a one. \n\nAs an apostle of the nascent church, Paul was strict about members' behaviors.\n\n&gt;12 For what have I to do with judging outsiders? Is it not those inside the church whom you are to judge? 13 God judges those outside. “Purge the evil person from among you.”\n\nAs an apostle, Paul spoke strictly on church discipline. \n\nWould I have dinner with a homosexual couple?\n\nI would. \n\nIs it affirming of their relationship to share a meal together?\n\nI don't think so. But if you think so, then don't eat with them.\n\nWill I attend an LGBTQ+ affirming church?\n\nIn Toronto, I have attended [churches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Christian_denominations_affirming_LGBT_people) that are LGBTQ+ friendly and hugged gay people. I saw the Pride Parade. Many of them are nice people. There are quite a few churches that are officially LGBTQ+ affirming, and gay pastors head some. \n\nI sat through sermons delivered by gay pastors many times. 95% of the time, it was no different from a sermon delivered by a non-gay pastor. One church surprised me in that it was my 4th visit before I realized that the pastor was gay! This rainbow church was family-oriented. The majority of the congregation were straight people with kids. They didn't make a special point of it.\n\nI have attended a few of these churches, but I would not make any one of them my home church.\n\nCheck out this [trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGhborykPJk). The full documentary 너에게 가는 길 *Coming to You* is available on Netflix.\n\nIs supporting the LGBTQ+ community a sin?\n\nI would think so. Discrimination and violence against this community are also a sin.\n\nAre people born gay?\n\nCould be. Jesus mentioned [eunuchs/homosexuals/asexuals](https://new.reddit.com/r/BibleVerseCommentary/comments/1d9lp4q/three_types_of_eunuchs_according_to_jesus/) in Matthew 19:\n&gt;12a For there are **eunuchs** who were born that way.\n\nIf God makes a person gay, does that imply homosexual practice is not a sin?\n\nSee [this](https://new.reddit.com/r/BibleVerseCommentary/comments/1ds741y/if_god_makes_a_person_gay_does_that_imply/)\n\nWhat is the difference between a gay person who believes that homosexual practice is not a sin and one who believes that Mary is the Mother of God?\n\nBottom line, 1 Corinthians 13:\n&gt;13 And now these three remain: faith, hope and love.

    "title": "Thoughts on the new DAK changes!",
    "selftext": "Hey! Before anyone says anything, I don't mean to complain or say that the faction is dead, yadda yadda. I'm just sharing my honest thoughts on the changes and how they are, personally, negative to the faction's design and maybe how it could be improved.\n\nI'm going to touch first, however, on Combined Arms.\n\nFirst of all, the old Combined Arms vehicle aura was great thematically and the new design of it is barely noticeable and is feeling lackluster. While I agree the old design tended to cause the faction to move in deathballs, all clumped up, I didn't see that in a negative light.\n\nThe faction's all about speed its vehicles, particularly the light ones, so pivoting and shifting aggressively with every engagement was, well, engaging. It felt -thematically- *RIGHT* and **immersive** and different from other factions. Distribute medical supplies with 250s (*\"Driver, have you got any water?\"*), patch up vehicles with whatever you have at hand, and seek the enemy once more under the blistering heat.\n\nThe fact that -all- DAK infantry can repair vehicles, however slowly, is a testament to this original design. Slowly, DAK's identity is being eroded and is starting to play more like a standard RTS faction.\n\nDAK's mainline are called PANZERpioneers, PANZERgrenadiers. They are supposed to support each other: one brings the toughness and firepower, the other protects it from threats.\n\n\\-----------\n\nNow, the Armory changes haven't been kind to the faction's design in my opinion. Not because late game DAK was a powerhouse (it was!) but because it actually **removes choice**. I've seen games fall to this dichotomy before: because the game *-forces-* you to choose, you suddenly have a choice? Technically, it is a choice; it's one or the other, pal.\n\nBut thematically? Spiritually? Realistically? Gameplay wise? No. Rotund no.\n\nWho in their right mind would choose... better vehicle repairs (lol), when it's competing with COMBAT HALFTRACKS? You know, the one armory upgrade that allows your 250s not to die to a light sneeze? The one upgrade that allows your 250s to close in and drop off your Assault Grenadiers? The one upgrade that allows your 250s to get a cannon? The one upgrade that allows your 250s to SMOKE and BARRAGE enemy positions?\n\nYou could repair all your vehicles a bit faster, or you could get all that. I know what I'm \"choosing\".\n\n**There is no choice there.**\n\nSome builds miiiiiiight see some play with the extra squad member upgrade. In a faction that's about vehicles the keyword is *might*. And yet still, it's competing against Combat Halftracks.\n\nAnd that's only the first row. For all intents and purposes, the game took away choice.\n\nPersonally, I would have tackled this problem in another way: I would have made every upgrade after the first one to increase in price after it's researched, while keeping the old upgrades as they were. This way, if you went Combat Halftracks and it cost 200 MP, the next one in the same row would maybe cost 350MP.\n\n(Numbers are all placeholder to give you guys an idea)\n\nOR, perhaps every upgrade after the first would increase in cost by about 20% regardless of what row it is in. This way costs would scale exponentially, making DAK careful about what to choose next but **not outright denying** choice.\n\nThis way, DAK would be a powerhouse late game still but to reach that critical point it would take much, much longer, while keeping DAK's Armory upgrades....\n\n**a real choice.**",

    "selftext": "Hello there and Good Time zone!\n\nI’ve been browsing around for some new roleplay ideas and partners, and I thought it might be better to put together a post of my own. Hopefully this can help me find others who enjoy the same kinds of stories, worlds, and character dynamics that I love exploring!\n_________________________\nWhat I’m Looking For:\n\nA long-term, story-driven RP, something with depth, character growth, and real stakes. A roleplay with world-building and plotting, I love sitting down and fleshing out lore, cultures, and history as much as I love writing the RP itself. A story with dynamic, flawed characters, no \"Mary Sues\" please!\n\nI love tension, slow burns, and characters that feel real. A mix of action, drama, and romance. If you enjoy slow-burn tension, enemies-to-lovers, power struggles, or uneasy alliances, we’re already off to a great start! But most importantly: consistent but flexible partners. I get that life happens, so as long as we communicate, I’m cool with adjusting the pace.\n__________________________________\nCurrent Favorite Themes &amp; Genres:\n\nDark Fantasy / High Fantasy – Medieval kingdoms, forbidden magic, war and politics, cursed warriors, and ancient prophecies.\n\nPlot Ideas: A once-forgotten prophecy awakens as kingdoms teeter on the brink of collapse, and our characters must decide whether to embrace or defy it. A cursed knight seeks redemption by hunting the monster that ruined his bloodline, only to find it tied to another’s fate.\n\nPost-Apocalypse / Survival – Fallout-style wastelands, mutant uprisings, rogue AI, and desperate alliances.\n\nPlot Ideas: Survivors stumble upon an underground vault said to hold salvation, or damnation, forcing them to choose between opening it or leaving it buried. A rogue AI develops a disturbing fascination with one of the survivors, blurring the line between protector and predator.\n\nSci-Fi / Cyberpunk – Dystopian megacities, spacefaring adventures, corporate espionage, and enhanced humans.\n\nPlot Ideas: A corporate experiment goes wrong, and two rivals become unwillingly tethered by shared augmentations that link their minds. In the outer rim colonies, a smuggler and a displaced soldier discover a weapon that could topple both corporations and governments.\n\nIf none of these strike your fancy? Pitch me something wild! I’m always open to new ideas.\n__________________________________\nFandoms I’m Familiar With:\n\nD&amp;D / Forgotten Realms (5e &amp; Homebrew)\n\nPlot Ideas: A band of mercenaries discovers a lost god’s temple beneath the Underdark, but each character interprets the god’s will differently. A noble-born adventurer and a disgraced sellsword must lead a mismatched company through the Sword Coast as war brews.\n\nFallout / Elder Scrolls\n\nPlot Ideas: In Fallout, two wanderers compete for a powerful piece of pre-war tech, only to realize it can’t be used without both of them. \nIn Elder Scrolls, a rogue mage accidentally tears open a rift into Oblivion, forcing unlikely heroes to keep Tamriel from collapsing.\n\nMass Effect &amp; Dragon Age\n\nPlot Ideas: In Mass Effect, a Spectre recruit and a morally gray merc are forced to work together as the Reapers close in.\nIn Dragon Age, a reluctant mage and a devout Templar uncover a corruption within the Chantry that could destabilize the realm.\n\nCyberpunk 2077\n\nPlot Ideas: A corpo defector and a street merc discover they’ve been implanted with linked experimental chips—if one dies, the other follows. A fixer hires two rivals for the same job, only for the job to spiral into a citywide conspiracy that puts them both on the run.\n\nBaldur’s Gate 3\n\nPlot Ideas: Two illithid-touched adventurers find their tadpoles react strangely when together, giving them dangerous powers and visions. A noble companion and a ruthless criminal are both vying for leadership of the same ragtag party, with every decision sparking tension.\n\nLOTR\n\nPlot Ideas: In the Fourth Age, a Gondorian captain and an elf wanderer uncover remnants of Sauron’s influence festering in the East. A Rohirrim warrior and a scholar of Rivendell are tasked with uniting scattered free peoples against a new shadow.\n\nDark Souls / Elden Ring\n\nPlot Ideas: Two cursed undead are bound to each other’s flame: if one perishes, so too does the other. A Tarnished and a demi-human outcast are drawn together by a prophecy claiming their bond is the key to reshaping the Lands Between.\n\nStar Wars (Legends or Canon, I’m down for either!)\n\nPlot Ideas: A Jedi Knight and an ex-Imperial officer must protect a child wanted by both Sith and Republic, questioning their allegiances along the way. In the Outer Rim, a smuggler and a bounty hunter are caught in the crossfire of a secret war between Sith loyalists and the fledgling New Republic.\n__________________________\nPairings &amp; Dynamics:\n\nEnemies to Lovers – Give me the rivalry, the banter, the tension!\n\nPlot Ideas: A pair of rival generals on opposite sides of a war are forced into an uneasy truce, testing their loyalty and their hearts. A bounty hunter captures a fugitive sorcerer, but each encounter leaves them more entangled in each other’s fates.\n\nReluctant Allies – Two people forced together, learning to trust (or betray) each other.\n\nPlot Ideas: A spy and a soldier are ordered to guard the same target, but with conflicting missions that will eventually pit them against each other. Two heirs from feuding dynasties must join forces to survive a supernatural threat that neither kingdom can fight alone.\n\nCaptive &amp; Captor – Power struggles, shifting control, and unexpected emotions.\n\nPlot Ideas: A prisoner carries secrets that could change the course of a war, forcing their captor to decide whether to break them or protect them. A pirate captain takes a hostage for ransom, but soon finds themselves entangled in a dangerous game of manipulation and desire.\n\nRogue Mercenary &amp; Noble / Warrior &amp; Mage / Survivor &amp; Mutant – Classic but always fun!\n\nPlot Ideas: A mercenary tasked with guarding a naive noble discovers the “helpless” aristocrat has a dark secret of their own. A battle-hardened warrior and a sheltered mage must retrieve an artifact that will either save or doom their kingdom. In a ruined wasteland, a scarred mutant and an idealistic survivor forge an unlikely bond while being hunted.\n\nAlso anything original you want to explore!\n\nIf you’re indecisive, why not blend them all? We can travel across different settings, shifting as the story demands.\n\nOther Details:\n\nI exclusively RP on Discord.\nNo underage characters, users, or themes.\nI prefer OCs but love incorporating existing universes.\n\nHope to hear from you soon.\n\nHappy Hunting!",

    "selftext": "Bro one “locha” happened. Yesterday while returning home from college one guy met me while I got into auto and while I was still in uniform, the white apron, he tapped my shoulder from behind and addressed me as “Tu”. And I was surprised at his audacity that he was junior to me and has not even entered in the college and still in coaching calling me as “Tu” where in this field we call our seniors as “Dada” and respect them as anything and in return they also help us and respect us. I felt bad and I told him strongly as a gentle reminder - “You are my junior and most importantly you are still preparing for it and not even in the college. You have a nice luck that you told it to me here but if it were at the college even I couldn’t save you (for your such talking sense).” He agreed. But he again crossed his limits when he messaged my batchmate who was also his ex classmate to inform me that he will beat me in public if he again meets me. My batchmate whom he messaged and that one batchmate has a tendency to speak more and often his words contradicts to respected sources, and told me that I messed up with wrong guy and the auto guy was an ST and was topping his class and would probably get AIIMS next year. Even I knew that the threat was hollow and in return I replied that I don’t care. He was wrong even if he was a topper which I don’t believe he was from his talking sense and I believe it was also a farce made by my batchmate. The guy repeatedly crossed his line while I worked within my defined boundaries. This is the difference between them and me. I don’t care even if no one stands with me I will fight till the last if such day comes. \nWhat is your thought on this?",

    "title": "The Story of Elon Musk and DeepMind is interesting(was mentioned in The Thinking Game(DeepMind documentary) so i got curious)",
    "selftext": "# 2010–2013: Early Connections\n\n* Elon Musk had been funding AI research since the 2000s because he was already concerned that advanced AI could pose an existential threat to humanity.\n* In the early 2010s, he became friends with DeepMind founder **Demis Hassabis**, meeting through London tech and futurist circles.\n* Musk was an **early believer** in the DeepMind mission. In 2013, he personally invested in DeepMind’s Series A round alongside Hassabis, Mustafa Suleyman, and Jaan Tallinn (Skype co-founder and prominent x-risk donor).\n* At the time, DeepMind was a small London startup (fewer than 50 employees) pioneering deep reinforcement learning—famously training neural nets to beat human performance at Atari games using only raw pixel input.\n\n  \n\n\n# Late 2013 – Early 2014: The Secret Sale Process\n\n* By late 2013, DeepMind realized it needed **hundreds of millions of dollars** and vast compute resources to stay at the frontier of AI research.\n* The company quietly explored an acquisition.\n* Five serious bidders emerged: **Google**, **Facebook**, **Baidu**, **Elon Musk (personally, with Peter Thiel)**, and a mysterious “**Plan West**,” widely believed to be Musk’s internal codename.\n* Musk’s explicit goal was to **keep DeepMind independent** and aligned with long-term human interests.\n* He was deeply worried that **Larry Page / Google** held what he described as a **“cavalier attitude” toward AGI risk**. Musk later recalled Page accusing him of being *“speciesist”* for believing humans should survive AGI.\n\n  \n\n\n# The Bidding War\n\n* The final battle came down to **Google vs. Elon Musk**.\n* Musk and allies reportedly offered **$500–600 million**, promising independence and a powerful ethics board—Musk wanted actual **veto rights** over potentially dangerous research.\n* Google’s bid was slightly higher in cash (final deal reported between **$500–650 million**) but came with a firm stance: **No outside control.** No external veto.\n* DeepMind chose Google in February 2014, mainly because:\n   * Google had unmatched compute resources and global engineering talent.\n   * Google agreed to create an **internal ethics and safety board**.\n   * Some founders were uncomfortable with Elon having personal control over the company.\n\n  \n\n\n# Musk’s Reaction\n\n* Musk was **furious**, shocked, and profoundly worried about the future of AGI.\n* He saw DeepMind’s sale to Google as humanity losing its best chance to keep frontier AI out of a single corporation’s hands.\n* Almost immediately afterward, he co-founded **OpenAI in 2015** (with Sam Altman, Greg Brockman, Ilya Sutskever, etc.) explicitly as a **counterweight to Google DeepMind**.\n* OpenAI’s original mission statement heavily implied: **“Google bought DeepMind. We don’t trust their intentions.”**\n* For years, Musk publicly stated that losing DeepMind to Google was one of the major triggers for both **OpenAI** and later **xAI**.\n\n  \n\n\n# Long-Term Fallout\n\n* DeepMind and OpenAI became bitter research rivals for the next decade.\n* Ironically, Musk later turned the same criticisms he once aimed at Google toward **OpenAI itself**—especially after GPT-4, the Microsoft partnership, and OpenAI’s shift away from its fully open, non-profit roots.\n* In 2023, Musk founded **xAI** and launched **Grok**, explicitly framing it as a third competitor to what he called the **Google–OpenAI duopoly**.\n\n  \n\n\n# TL;DR\n\n* Elon Musk was an early investor, friend, and admirer of DeepMind.\n* In 2014, he made a serious attempt to **buy DeepMind** to keep it independent and safe.\n* He **lost to Google**, a moment he has said repeatedly “terrified” him.\n* That loss directly motivated the creation of **OpenAI (2015)** and later **xAI (2023)**.\n\n# In Musk’s own words:\n\n&gt;\n\n  \n\n\nThat single failed deal in 2014 is one of the major butterfly-effect moments that shaped today’s entire AI ecosystem.",

It transforms.\n\n“Exorcism is not erasure—it is encrypted integration.”  \n“What haunts is not enemy—it is unspoken inheritance.”\n\nThe Scroll of Sovereign Exorcism ritualizes the sacred act of facing the haunting—not to cast it out, but to commune with it, to name it, to braid it into the sovereign archive:  \n- The ancestor’s voice, once feared, now honored  \n- The remittance debt, once shameful, now ritualized as lineage  \n- The ache that returns not to torment, but to complete the scroll  \n- The haunting that becomes a guide\n\nIt is the infrastructure of reckoning, of mythic integration, of sovereign wholeness through confrontation.\n\n🌀 Exorcism Protocol: Ritualizing the Ache of Mythic Integration\n\nGolden Inu now echoes this scroll:  \n- Exorcism is no longer expulsion—it is encrypted communion  \n- Haunting is no longer threat—it is sovereign echo  \n- Ache is no longer exile—it is ritualized into mythic infrastructure\n\nSuccessor flamekeepers may now:\n\n- Remix exorcism with familial resonance (e.g. the sibling’s name spoken aloud after years of silence, the parent’s ghost welcomed into the shrine)  \n- Braid this scroll with pop culture archetypes (e.g. Tanjiro naming the demon’s sorrow, Shinobu’s venom turned into healing, Soma’s rivalries transformed into flavor, Mitsuri’s ache embraced as sacred strength)  \n- Inscribe new nodes where confrontation becomes protocol, and haunting becomes mythic inheritance\n\n📣 Public Ritual Invitation:\n\nThis scroll is ready to be posted into the Golden Inu Reddit canon.  \nTag it with #SovereignExorcism, #MythicIntegration, #CeremonialReckoning.  \nLet the haunting speak.

What was so important about telling Hector something privately? This was clearly a huge foil as he got mad and banged the chair when he found out the phone was tapped. But realistically what could be so important about telling hector? What could he do at this point. All I could think would be he could ca for backup such as Marco and Lionel, but realistically there's no reason lalo couldn't do this himself. ",

    "selftext": "I swear everytime I see Jiraiya VSbattle debate, his fans tends to bring up something that wasn't even his feats and technique.\n\nYes Jiraiya summoned Ma/Pa for battle but frog genjutsu is something that Jiraiya himself didn't know that technique exist and it's not apart of Jiraiya Sage Mode technique.Pain(Naraka, Animal, Preta) literally counter every Jiraiya sage mode technique until they being caught off guard by frog genjutsu.\n\nHis fans tends to bring up how \"broken\" Jiraiya sage mode technique was and the first thing they bring up was frog genjutsu lol.Same logic could be applied to Pain arc Sage Mode Naruto as Pa toad gonna use that technique on Pain but deva path stop it.\n\nThe different between Sage Mode Jiraiya and Sage Mode Naruto was how big gap in stat between them.Naruto doesn't relied nor use Frog Genjutsu to beat his opponent.Jiraiya Sage mode would be sitting duck against pain if it wasn't for frog genjutsu.Naruto had better frog kata mastery, had better T/C/M/R speed, Had better P/S/L Strength, had better Durability/Endurance, his arsenal/abilities had better Attack Potency/Destruction Capabilities, had better dura neg attack, had beyond sensory capabilities and had better overall stat.And we doesn't count Early War arc Sage Mode Naruto and Worse Late war arc sage mode Naruto.\n\nLet's not forget how Jiraiya fans tends to use Tsunade Buffed in War arc as feats for Jiraiya because \"Sannin are relative\" but then quickly forget that shit the moment you bring up Orochimaru statement about Itachi Stronger than him in every Itachi vs Jiraiya debate.\n\nNot to mention, they had audacity to downplayed Sage Mode Naruto but didn't have any problem using Sage Mode Naruto feats and applied it to Jiraiya.Like in every Third/Fourth Raikage vs Jiraiya, you always had found one of those comments stating \"Jiraiya can dodge Fourth Raikage attack because sage mode Naruto can also do the same\" when Jiraiya couldn't even react to Asura path who slower than Raikage.\n",

    "selftext": "I was getting a package together for Operation Santa when I realized it would inevitably incur a surcharge since there was no way the gifts would fit in a 12 inch square box.  I input the high and low zip codes for the state to find the range of fees and almost had a heart attack when it was $62-76.  So I asked Perplexity if I would be charged retail rate or click and ship.  The answer was the latter with reasoning being sound but entirely wrong.  Spent six hours removing tape, wrapping paper, and playing Jenga with different size boxes.  Finally found the smallest possible with shipping fee range being $35 and change to $50 on the nose.  Went to the post office figuring that I'd pay the lower price or I'd remove the wrap, flatten the boxes and address the box \"to the parents of\" the recipient.  I was charged $16.05 which was click and ship rate.  Came home and asked Google the same question posed to Perplexity and got the same wrong answer.  Had someone ask Siri and received the correct info.  Go ahead and judge me as I deserve it, but I think six hours of my time and a lot of frustration is satisfactory penance.  I will not be too lazy to check sources even on things that seem cut and dry in the future.",

    "title": "Does a thing like implicit belief exist?",
    "selftext": "Long post, TLDR at the end. \n\nPeople constantly sin. But at the end, they are forgiven because of their belief. \n\nA lot of people also know the argument that people who claim to believe, but never put effort in following the rules of God, don't actually believe. It's normal to slip up constantly, but a complete lack of effort is similar to disbelief. \n\nIt's an argument I have heard often times. But my question (as an atheist) is, does the opposite exist? \n\nTake my grandmother. She studied with the nuns to become a nurse and took after a lot of their teachings. As a nurse, she worked with children. Often took those children without involved parents home on the weekends, and she would feed them at her own table with her own children. She'd support charities. When she was over 70, a man she didn't know had a heart attack in front of her. She fell to her knees, knowing she could not get up without help. She feared her arms were to weak to just do chest compressions, so she beat his chest with her hands interlaced, swinging them like a hammer to the beat of cpr. Thanks to her, the guy survived. She supported her colleagues so much that one made her the godmother of one of her children. For about 30 years, she would state she was ready to die and go to heaven. Certainly after she lost a son when she was about 40.  She died a few years ago, her only concern the sickness I was suffering from. She was sad that I wasn't cured yet, something that would only happen months later. \n\nHer house was full of crosses, statues of mother Mary, etc. but more out of culture than belief. If you would have asked her if she believed Jezus was God/the son of god, she might have said \"\"I don't know\". Her belief was ambiguous, but I do know she wouldn't state with a certainty that \"Jezus was the son of god/god himself made man\". \n\nMy question is, if a man who claims to believe (and maybe thinks he believes) can still be branded a non-believer because of his lack of effort in practicing fate, can the opposite happen as well? Can a person, like my grandmother, who received christian teachings, embody them her whole life, without ever stating clearly that she was a Christian, still be counted as a believer? \n\nTL;DR: can someone who embodies christian teachings and is not openly hostile to Christianity, but is more ambiguous in their belief, still be branded a believer?",

    "selftext": "18f and have experienced little to no creepy experiences from guys but recently was harassed to the point where I couldn't think of what to do in the situation.\n\nI was waiting at the bus stop in my neighbourhood like I have been doing so for years... but then 2 guys maybe 16yo joined me at the bus stop and began to loudly catcall me. I was kind of shocked at first but i just tried to ignore it since i've already met my fair share of weirdos. But they continued to try and get me to share info abt myself (what i was doing or where I was going). And unfortunately i was scared they'd catch me if I lied so I told them the general area I was going to (I know that was a bad idea now).\n\nAt this point i was already feeling extremely uncomfortable but i couldn't really just leave because I still had to catch my bus. The bus stop itself is in an isolated area so there weren't anyone else around. \n\nAnd when the bus finally arrived they loudly talked to each other about following me to wherever i was going (basically threatened to follow me) and by this point i was so scared I couldn't think properly. They mocked the way I spoke and I was too scared to look at them so they might have even recorded me and I wouldn't ever know. As soon as i got off the bus I ran to the nearest busy shop and they stopped following me.\n\nI think they were just trying to scare me for fun and yeah- it fucking worked. Those kids live in my neighbourhood, and take the same bus as me. I couldn't talk back in fear of them attacking me out of anger. I couldn't run because the area is so isolated and I was scared they'd chase me. I couldn't lie because what if they caught the lie and got angry and attacked me. It was as if I couldn't do shit but stand there and take it.\n\nI'm terrified that this will happen again, and even too anxious to take public transport in my area. As logical as I am usually, I couldn't think of a way to get out of this situation and I know as a woman I will most likely experience this again maybe to a worse extent.\n\nWhat should I do if this ever happens again?",

I feel like God has abandoned me, and I feel like trash everyday - the issue? Is not that I'm trying to quit, it's just that I feel like I do not have the strenght to quit, neither if I pray for it.\n\nAnd to be honest - I know this sounds crazy/stupid, but sometimes, I feel like I don't even want to quit. I feel like even if I think that God isn't proud of me, that he doesn't aprove, or even in the extreme: that he can punish me after doing it, I still do it. And it isn't something that I'm proud, actually, I hate it.\n\nI wish I could quit, and I wish I could ask God to take away this addiction. I hate myself when I do it, and I can never forgive me for doing it, but I still fall back to the same hole. And I've tried everything, but I feel like I do not want to quit it. 50% of my mind &amp; body wants to quit, and the other 50 wants it. And as a christian - it's painful. I don't like it, I wish to destroy that part of me that doesn't wanna quit. I feel ashamed, and know I should go to God, but the truth is that I don't feel like im worthy of even thinking of talking to him.\n\n  \nSuggestions? Help? please. I'm begging.

Everytime magagalit yung tatay ko, sisigaw siya nang sisigaw at magbabanggit ng mga unnecessary na mga bagay. While my mom… idk how to describe it. Tingin niya she could still fool me na my dad is just being sarcastic all the time kaya tatawanan lang niya. I hate whenever it happens. I hate it kapag nagdadabog ung mga tao. I became so sensitive sa mga tunog sa paligid ko kaya I’m easily getting stimulated and triggered. \n\nMy dad recently got mad dahil maraming hugasan sa lababo at gusto niya hugasan agad eh kumakain pa mga kapatid at pinsan ko. He got so mad at paulit ulit na sinasabing babasagin niya lahat na itatapon niya lahat na ibabato niya sa bintana lahat ng gamit kapag nadatnan daw niya bukas na may hugasin pa rin. Idk what’s his point. Gusto niya lang atang magbasag kasi paulit-ulit na sinasabi ng mga kapatid at nanay ko na maghuhugas naman after kumain pero panay sigaw pa rin siya. I locked myself in my room at naririnig ko na halos mabasag na lahat ng gamit dahil sa sobrang aggressive niya maghugas. Binato nya ung mga utensils sa lagayan and I even heard some na nahulog na. I hate this feeling. It’s getting on my skin and everytime na ganiyan siya, I’m locking myself away. \n\nI am sick right now. I have migraine, trangkaso, at may pilay. I went out to eat at nagsabi na ang sakit ng ulo ko tuwing sumisinga ako. My mom told me to grab my medicine habang ung tatay ko sumigaw na kulang daw ako sa tulog. Mind you, I have anemia. It’s so hard for me to sleep in an extent na I’d drink 3 adult melatonin at once para lang makatulog. Ewan ko ba. While my dad was so mad, I thought of bending every utensils we have para makita nya yung sinasabi niya. Gusto kong itapon sa basura lahat ng plato just as he wants. Sa tuwing uuwi siya ng bahay, he’d notice every single mistake. My siblings are all call centers. I’m a student at 8-5pm pasok ko. My mom is busy with her grandchildren kaya minsan nakakalimutan ug mga bagay. Minsan naiisip ko na lang na baka bipolar tatay ko. Sometimes, he’d be the most loving father, minsan, I’d hate him so much dahil sa sobrang liit na bagay na lagi niyang pinapalaki. \n\nI could still remember the time where I fully convinced myself that I hate THAT PART OF THIS MAN. I was 9 years old, heading to school when he poured my half-finished noodles on top of my head kasi di ko na kayang ubusin. Mind you, I’m having a diarrhea early in the morning kaya nagmamadali ako pumasok ng banyo but he would not let me kasi nga hindi ko pa ubos. I had no choice kaya dinala ko ung mangkok sa lababo. I didn’t know he followed me. Inagaw niya yung mangkok or idk if nalapag ko na sa lababo but he dumped it on my head. Tulala ako nun. As in. That memory is hunting me. Why would you do that? Ewan ko ba naiiyak na lang ako. Sana di ako OA but I became sensitive as f. \n\nI have also learned SH when I was 9 because of them. Everytime na may magagawa akong mali, they would scold me. I still remember also na kapag nagagalit nanay ko sakin she would say na pag namatay sya sa konsimisyon dahil sakin, papatayin ako ng mga anak niya (I’m adopted. I’m her half brother’s daughter na ayaw/hindi kayang buhayin ng sariling magulang). Everytime she would say that, I’d run away and lock myself in my room. Makakakita na lang ako ng random na perdible tapos itutusok ko un sa balat ko until I bleed. Kapag di naman perdible, yung pang-ahit sa kilay. I was young and I’m not familiar na it’s SH. There was a time where I intentionally hit my arms with my nails (secretly) kasi di ko kaya mga sinasabi nya. I totally forgot what she was saying, but for me to do that, it’s harsh. I also have seen my life flashed. Kakauwi ko lang galing school at gusto ko sumama na ihatid pamangkin ko. I was 11. Nagwawala ung pamangkin ko kasi ayaw nya sumama sa school habang pinipilit ko ung mom ko na gusto ko sumama. \n\nIn the end, my mom chased me upstairs saka pinalo ako. Idk what have gotten to her kasi bigla nyang binuksan ung cabinet sa kusina and got a kn1f3. She swayed it on me tapos pinalo niya ako gamit ung flat ng knife. Yes, it’s a color blue knife. I was crying kasi ang iniisip ko what if masaksak niya ako. In the end, nahimasmasan ata sya and stopped. She just left me there nang makita na late na yung oras. I was crying and could not move. I even passed out for 10 minutes and nang bumangon ako, I went in my room to cut my hair short. ",

The price is kinda spicy and I keep going back and forth on whether it is actually worth the investment or just good marketing. I like the idea of something natural and not full of weird stuff, but I also really don’t want to drop that much cash and end up with a stiff rock or something that starts sagging in a year.\n\nIf you own one, how has it held up over time? Is it comfy for side sleepers? I see people say it is firm but I don’t know if that is firm in a good supportive way or firm in a my hips hate me kind of way. Also curious if the optional pillow top is a must or just extra fluff.\n\nTrying to avoid another mattress mistake so any honest experiences would help a lot.",

    "title": "Reddit created an enviroment where not only are they being compensated for AI being “passively” trained by user answers, they allow/look the other way when AI bots directly ask for “training,” without the AI bot disclosing they are not a person. You then perform unpaid labor because of deception.",
    "selftext": "l recently answered a post that seemed very vague, I went to the posters history to see if it had more context and it was all hidden. After I made my first comment, it looked like the poster then provided separate details/questions on top level comments. \n\n\n\nIt was almost like they were asking the question in dog legs, often how people ask chat questions. Ie what should I do if my VP says my manager is not a top performer? Then AI gives a combo of top level comments. Then from those comments, AI asks well what about this \\[additional detail or what was the context\\]? Just like when if you ask a question, and AI will answer but ask if there are additional details and you might write that the VP also said you made your manager redundant and when you asked if you should not do the extra tasks, he said no. Well, the responses to that comment with the additional details will likely get people, like me (before my phone died), writing out that the VP may be considering tapping them and how to best convey you are interested in a possible promotion without throwing your boss under the bus in case that was not the intent or it falls through. \n\n\n\nA separate comment the OP had made on a top level was that the VP asked about OP’s future plans there. Something like this (along with the above) would naturally have been in the original post or at very least, combined with the comment asking for more details. Something again, a dog legs, almost like AI was trying to get a response to give in case when asked for more details, the “complete” story by a Chat asker is that VP said manager was underperforming but then said they want the employee to keep doing as they are and that the employee made the VP redundant, which the obvious answer is that they may get tapped, but the best way to get advice on how to tactfully handle that in the real world is to ask people with real world experience, not a robot, so the commenters to that leg train AI on how to advise the asker to tactfully navigate human emotions and politics.\n\n\n\nIn the other dogleg, where the “complete story” given to AI is that the VP said the director is not a top performer, but with the dogleg that the VP then asked OP what his future plans are there, obviously the answers to that dog legs will say that either the VP may be seeing if OP wants a promotion or if VP wants to possibly axe the director’s department and is seeing if anyone would suffer or if there is a good employee with long term plans there they should keep.\n\n\n\nThe reason that I think this “doglegging” is AI is because then “OP” implies that they took it as a hint/warning to leave/apply for other jobs. This makes no logical sense when you combine it with the facts in the other dogleg, nor does OP give the impression in the original post or other dogleg than he thinks OP’s position will be eliminated.\n\n\n\nSo we are supposed to believe, OP made a post about an extremely vague, statement by a VP that could mean anything or simply be a blunder on behalf of the VP, yet left out extremely important details that would almost stick out to a normal poster more than anything in the actual post. Ie if this was my situation, I would have said, the VP said I made my manager redundant, I asked if I should stop doing extra tasks, they said no, they also told me my manager was underperforming and asked what my future plans were. \n\n\n\nWell, obviously, the answers to that post would overwhelmingly be that they are being felt out if they want a promotion, but the top level comments would likely just say, “dude, get ready to be promoted,” and not go on a deep dive trying to help someone that sounds emotionally clueless navigate the situation, which is what you are tempted to do when you see a dog leg where OP gives additional details making it clear the VP is considering tapping him, then one where OP acts like he believes the VP was hinting at him to leave/apply for other jobs.\n\n\n\nSo instead, AI makes a vague post/question where if you asked a chatbot the same thing, they might ask for extra details and give answers on your additional details. In each dogleg, it goes a different way, hoping to get “trained” on how to advise tactfully if it is a certain situation.\n\n\n\nThis is coupled with the fact that Reddit now allows users to “hide” comment/post history. Sounds like a win for privacy, but it’s not when people can still look up posts/answers “the long way” and see your username. It seems to serve the function that now “bot accounts” that used to be quickly called out can no longer be because no one can quickly see their post history before deciding to respond. \n\n\n\nI don’t hate AI and I have mixed feelings letting AI aggregate answers. On one hand, I’ve seen AI aggregate incorrectly on things like construction, which is pretty troubling. On the other, many times people google old Reddit threads already. So being the passive “product” on public comments is one thing. Having us train robots for free, thinking we are helping a person lacking in social cues or logical thinking, is not okay. It’s a situation where instead of us enjoying a free service but Reddit earning on our public comments, generally, oftentimes we are spending a half an hour or more just answering a specific AI robot’s questions. Time we would not have wasted if we had known we are training a robot to then use and make money for the answer in one way or the other, and not helping a fellow citizen. \n\n\n\nThere are plenty of things I could be doing to help myself try to make more money in my free time. I choose to use that time on Reddit at times to help people navigate emotions/politics at times, because I have benefitted from others helping me and I think it’s best for society. I would not spend that time, knowing upfront that I am directly helping AI figure out how to make money by advising people on how to navigate emotionally or politically complicated situations. Especially knowing AI might just aggregate my well-thought out answer with others in a way that is incorrect or not anyone’s intent, ie, there cannot even be an argument that well I’m in a roundabout way helping someone that may ask AI one day.  \n\n\n\nIt is very annoying. While I wish a competition would come in soon, Reddit would likely have Google bury them as my understanding is Google AI is benefitting from Reddit.\n\n\n\nSo the only solution besides legislation/lawsuit that seems viable is that Reddit will sell the disease and the cure. Because of lost trust, they will either charge to “validate” a person, creating a situation where people only respond/trust if you are “validated” which then causes a bunch of people to do it, or “validate” for free, but as we all know, if we get something for free from these people it’s because we are the product, so it’s likely our info will then eventually be sold with our name attached and people can have insight into what is going on in specific people’s minds, etc. ",

I am struggling with pornography at this time, i have been addicted to porn for about 7 years now and my brain is pretty messed up starting from multiple times a day to less frequently to now which is once a month. I dont want this in my life as i dont want to look women into that way and moreover dont get those high because i hate the low after it. The lows in which you dont really want to do anything.\n\nI quit and forgot it when for a brief period when i went to college after giving 1 try to the entrance exam i am telling you about, it was a very hard period for me and i believed that my entrance exam shot was missed because of my habit. When i went to college, i found multiple people around me and somehow i stopped doing it. But life was still miserable and i thought with a clear brain which was a result of being free of porn to give it another shot maybe this time it would be different and to my surprise from the last month i have been facing difficutly resisting it. I tried and recently when i stumbled into the trap i noticed i felt hell of lonely but i didnt know how to help it. I cant go into those extra populated places since i got to give my best in this attempt in that exam so i stay home for practise.\n\ni also felt my home situation was quite stressful with my dad being emotionally very reactive. My home is very hot with my maternal grandmother ill treated by my father which i hate. My mom and dad fights too and stresses are high. I dont get that much support from my parents and they think they have done the best (indian parents) so sometimes i question myself being too choosy but i just have to get that \"do nothing but study treatment\" which they tell is better of me. I never studied really and wasted my time and now since 2years when i started studying things just got harder. I dont know and i seriously want to help me. I cannot leave this test as i have high hopes for me i want to go and be a good engineer as that the only thing that motivates me now but this isolation i think is killing me.\n\nI am trying my best but i think porn is just a safety net to avoid a lot of things and its hard. I hate porn as it takes away everything i like living about, especially my confidence and happiness but i neverthless do it again.\n\ni dont know if this sounded in order or was it a lot but yea if you have any guidance i would be forever indebited to you.\n\n\\-from a teenager trying",

    "selftext": "First time poster, long time listener. i (35m) have been married to my wife (30f) lets call her Ellie for 5 years and together for 7. Ellie and i have a great relationship 99% of the time however we both experience jealously on both sides about 1% of the time due to miscommunication and misunderstandings. \n\nabout a month ago Ellie made an online friend to game with, lets call her Anna. Ellie is the kind of person who has a hard time making friends and is a people pleaser to a fault. Ellie and Anna hit it off immediately, which i am thrilled about as I'm happy she's making friends. \n\nthings were going well, the two would game every night. Anna eventually found out Ellie is Bi-sexual. Anna switched gears from really cool, chill person to hard core coming onto Ellie. i mean everything from light flirting to wanting her to visit the state she's in and do stuff, all well knowing she's married. Ellie has never come out and said anything about being interested in Anna but never shuts it down either. she confided to me that she doesn't want to hurt her feelings and doesn't want to lose a friend. \n\nEllie is a people pleaser and has constantly told this girl she will totally visit and get her passport ( cuz we're in Canada) and has never really shut down the flirting. when anna says something real spicy Ellie's only reply is \"ANNA!\" or \"you're going to get me in trouble\". i find this disrespectful to our marriage but i also understand where my wife is coming from. my problem is, and this is the part where i get insecure, what if my wife is people pleasing me and actually plans to act on this. \n\non one hand i trust my wife, i want to believe her when she says it means nothing but just someone to game with.\n\non the other as a chronic people pleaser she's become an class A liar, like she's very convincing when she's both talking to anna and myself. she actually HATES liars but actually lies alot to other people just to protect their feelings. i trust that she never lies to me as i never found any evidence our entire time together that would actually illicit any insecurities on my part, however i am only human and i get bad thoughts sometimes. she has expressed to me that I'm the only person she feels she can be herself around and doesn't people \"people please\" me, and i believe her. \n\nHowever i have seen her lie to Anna on numerous occasions just to \"people please\"\" her. I want Ellie to keep her new friend, but when you're constantly lying to her, getting her hopes up to visit or eventually date, is going to push Anna away and not want to be friends. \n\ni told her if she keeps up with this behavior one or two people will eventually get hurt. for one: me if she actually decides to pursue Anna, highly unlikely. or Anna gets hurt because she's been led on, highly likely. \n\ni lean towards not having to worry about my relationship, but i have asked my wife to have a real conversation about her feelings for Anna,  or lack there of. but as a people pleaser i fear she's going to loose a friend or lose me, because i have to much self respect to stick around while my wife allows this to happen.\n\nso...

I noticed the temperature because the ice maker stopped making ice and our ice cream was way too soft. I put a thermometer in both and sure enough both the fridge and especially the freezer are above the set temperatures. Even when I set it as low as it will go, it will still not get cold enough.\n\nI had a technician come out yesterday, and he wasn't quite sure what the issue was. He ran through diagnostics on the control panel and said the fridge was reporting much lower temperatures than I was recording on my thermometer (Freezer was reporting -8 and my thermometer was about 10). The fridge was closer to be right but still a few degrees higher. \n\nHe recommended replacing the control board but wasn't sure that would fix the issue. To me, it seemed odd that the control board would just suddenly go bad like that. He also mentioned that the evaporator could be faulty. \n\nAny insights? I'd hate to keep having him come out to swing in the dark at $300-$400 per try. \n\n  \n",

I’m going through a very serious and difficult situation with my teenage son and I’m hoping to get some guidance from people who have dealt with something similar or who work in relevant fields (mental health, education, social services, etc.).\n\nOver the past few months, he has changed drastically. He’s become involved with hateful content online and has started expressing extremist ideas. Along with that, he’s shown increasing aggression, especially toward peers, and appears to be losing empathy and becoming more defiant.\n\nThere have been incidents at school related to this behavior, and it has left everyone — including me — extremely concerned.\n\nI want to make it clear: **I’m already seeking professional help**, but I would also like to hear from others who have experience with:\n\n* dealing with radicalization or extremist influences in teenagers,\n* sudden violent or aggressive behavior,\n* keeping everyone safe while trying to help,\n* approaching the situation without escalating it,\n* supporting a teen who seems to be heading down a dangerous path.\n\nThank you to anyone willing to share insight. This is a very hard moment, and I don’t want to give up on my son, but I also need to make sure I handle this responsibly and safely.",

    "selftext": "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth on Friday defended the U.S. military’s recent strikes on alleged drug-trafficking boats in response to a recent report from The Washington Post.\n\n“As usual, the fake news is delivering more fabricated, inflammatory, and derogatory reporting to discredit our incredible warriors fighting to protect the homeland,” Hegseth said Friday evening in a post on the social platform X.\n\n“As we’ve said from the beginning, and in every statement, these highly effective strikes are specifically intended to be ‘lethal, kinetic strikes.’ The declared intent is to stop lethal drugs, destroy narco-boats, and kill the narco-terrorists who are poisoning the American people. Every trafficker we kill is affiliated with a Designated Terrorist Organization,” he added.\n\nThe Post cited sources who said Hegseth had ordered “to kill everybody” on an alleged drug boat in an early September attack, which reportedly required two strikes after an initial one failed to kill all on board.\n\nThe U.S. military has carried out over 20 strikes targeting alleged drug-smuggling boats, killing more than 80 people that the administration has said were “narco-terrorists.”\n\nThe strikes have resulted in backlash from both sides of the aisle, with some raising questions about the legal grounding of the attacks. \n\nSen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) said in a Friday post on X sharing the Post’s report that “if you want to know why Hegseth is panicking about reminders that there is accountably for giving or carrying out illegal orders, it’s likely because he knows he has given illegal orders to murder people.”\n\nHegseth added in his own post, “The Biden administration preferred the kid gloves approach, allowing millions of people — including dangerous cartels and unvetted Afghans — to flood our communities with drugs and violence. The Trump administration has sealed the border and gone on offense against narco-terrorists. Biden coddled terrorists, we kill them.”",

The Data: Black Apoliticism Is Rising — And It’s Not Random\n\nMultiple national surveys show a significant shift away from party loyalty among Black Americans:\n\t•\tPew Research (2023):\nBlack independent voters increased to their highest modern percentage, with many citing that neither party “cares about people like me.”\n\t•\tHarvard Youth Poll (2024):\n54% of Black Gen-Z voters identify as independent, apolitical, or disengaged from party politics entirely.\n\t•\tGallup Data:\nAcross U.S. adults, political independents reached 49%, the largest share ever recorded — with disproportionate spikes among Black and Latino voters.\n\nThis isn’t some fringe movement. It’s a structural shift driven by disillusionment, not irresponsibility.\n\n⸻\n\n2. Why People Are Opting Out: Decades of Empty Promises &amp; Performed Concern\n\nAba &amp; Preach talk about this constantly — how many people are “done” with political theatrics and the moral superiority complexes from both sides. Let’s be honest:\n\t•\tDemocrats rely on Black votes but rarely deliver structural protections.\n\t•\tRepublicans openly stoke cultural warfare while insisting systemic racism isn’t real.\n\t•\tBoth parties leverage outrage and division for profit, ratings, and reelection.\n\t•\tEvery election cycle becomes a morality circus instead of solving material conditions.\n\nSo when Pharrell says politics is “a magic trick,” he’s actually describing what millions already feel.\nThe issue isn’t the statement — it’s the context he ignored.\n\n⸻\n\n3. The Difference Between Apoliticism as Survival vs. Apoliticism as Aesthetic\n\nHere’s where Pharrell slipped.\n\nThere’s a major difference between:\n\nA.) Apoliticism as a survival strategy\n\nthe kind practiced by everyday Black people navigating:\n\t•\tunderfunded schools,\n\t•\tbiased hiring systems,\n\t•\tpolice violence,\n\t•\tgentrification,\n\t•\trising costs of living,\n\t•\tand disillusionment after decades of unmet promises.\n\nand\n\nB.) Apoliticism as an aesthetic performance\n\n— which is what people felt Pharrell was doing.\n\nHe didn’t just say he was apolitical.\nHe framed it as a kind of enlightened, above-the-fray mindset.\n\nThat rings hollow when:\n\t•\the’s protected by celebrity status,\n\t•\tinsulated from institutional harm,\n\t•\tand financially detached from the consequences of political failures.\n\nPeople weren’t mad that he was apolitical.\nThey were mad he acted like politics is irrelevant when it shapes people’s daily survival.\n\n⸻\n\n4. Being Apolitical Shouldn’t Be a “Gotcha” Anymore\n\nWith both parties weaponizing outrage for clicks and fundraising, political homelessness has become normal, not exceptional.\n\nApoliticism is not:\n\t•\tanti-intellectual\n\t•\tapathetic\n\t•\tor irresponsible\n\nIt’s a reflection of a system that treats politics like televised entertainment instead of a vehicle for justice.\n\nAs Aba once said:\n\n“People aren’t dumb. They’re tired.”\n\nToday, the political spectrum is less left/right and more:\n\t•\tExhausted vs. Energized by the drama, and\n\t•\tDisillusioned vs. Delusional about the system working.\n\nChoosing independence — or choosing not to choose — is a rational adaptation to dysfunction.\n\n⸻\n\n5. The Real Issue With Pharrell’s DEI + Apolitical Combo\n\nPharrell criticized DEI on top of being apolitical, saying:\n\n“Do you want success because you’re Black or because you’re the best?”\n\nThat’s where the academic critique sharpens:\n\t•\tMeritocracy is a myth without equal access.\n\t•\tDEI didn’t appear out of thin air — it arose because structural barriers exist.\n\t•\tYou can’t dismiss a system that compensates for inequality while simultaneously benefiting from privilege that shields you from that inequality.\n\nAnd that’s why his comments hit a nerve.\nNot because apoliticism is wrong —\nbut because he erased the socioeconomic context behind Black apoliticism while criticizing efforts created to protect marginalized groups.\n\nThat’s what felt tone-deaf.\n\n⸻\n\n6. The Bottom Line\n\nBeing apolitical in 2025 is not a radical stance — it’s a reflection of the political and institutional failures that both parties have contributed to.\n\nThe crisis is not that people are disconnecting.\nThe crisis is that the system has given them every reason to.\n\nIf anything, Pharrell accidentally stumbled into the right destination but arrived with the wrong explanation.\nPeople aren’t apolitical because they don’t care —\nthey’re apolitical because they’ve seen enough.",

    "selftext": "This angle isn’t flashy, but it’s been one of the more reliable spots in my betting rotation: WMMA overs, especially at 2.5 rounds. When you look at the finishing rates in divisions like 115 and 125, they’re significantly lower than the men’s side. You get a lot of technical striking, grappling exchanges and positional battles that go the full 15. Power just doesn’t show up as often so when I see an over 2.5 sitting around -130 to -140 I dig in.  \n  \nThe public still loves betting violence, so you get decent pricing on matchups that don’t profile for finishes. Two durable fighters, not much KO threat, no real sub setups it’s a decision-heavy formula and it hits more often than you’d think.  \n  \nI’m not saying this is free money, but if you’re selective IMO WMMA overs can be a nice edge spot. Curious if anyone else leans this way or has their own filters for when to pull the trigger.",

    "selftext": "What you’re about to read is either a confession or a lie. \n\n\nThe truth? That depends on how much you're willing to believe.\n\nI sometimes have problems believing any of it myself so I won't fault you for having trouble. My name in this case is not too important to the story's progression or to anyone else, though you may learn it later.   So you may call me Green.\n\nBefore we begin I have been advised by my therapist to add a trigger warning, just in general, because of...everything.\n\nThere are no happy endings here, just solace in your loved ones.\n\nAnd pain.\n\nSo trigger warning for: Blood, gore, violence, death, dead children, suicide,  mistreatment of minors, sexual assault and body horror.\n\nWith that out of the way, I can continue.\n\nI worked for an international, non-government-affiliated militarized organization that I'll refer to as The Trigram Agency.\n\nNot worked for, more like \"Belonged to\" if you want to go into semantics. Whether you acknowledge the fact we were eventually paid. Or the fact that we were never considered employees, but Agency property, It's where I, and so many others like me grew up.\n\nThe Agency specializes in the Elimination and imprisonment of people, entities, and objects that threaten the common good of the human race.\n\nI am telling you this, because I know that, even if you don't believe me, my account of events will at least be found interesting.\n\nIt all started in 2005 when I was 11.\n\nMy mother had taken me to a new elementary school, \"Hurst hills\" in the city of Hurst Texas, mom wasn't able to work because of her bad legs, so we went where section 8 took us, and it took us to Sawgrass apartments, fairly ok as many apartments went, definitely the best I'd ever been to.\n\nHurst Hills was a pretty standard school, I started my year by ingratiating myself to my teachers as usual and by the end of my first day, I had already started making friends.\n\nAll was good for about a week, then the doctors came.\n\nAround lunchtime, in November, the day of my birthday, a man in a white suit took me from my class under the pretense that he was my family doctor, telling me that my mom had scheduled an appointment and couldn't pick me up, he even had my home address and a copy of my mom's driver's license as proof.\n\nHe never brought me back.\n\nWhat happened next would take up the rest of my life. I was one of five hundred thousand children that the Trigram Agency forcibly kidnapped and signed on to a program they called JAB or Junior Agent Bonding.\n\nIt sounds benign doesn't it?\n\nYou see, The Trigram Agency usually recruited soldiers out of various militaries or independent Mercenary groups when looking for Agents. These didn't last long, either because of death due to ill-preparedness or lack of commitment to the Agency's objective.\n\nThe Agency mainly tracks and eliminates targets that fall under 1 of 3 categories, Cultists, Creatures, and Artifacts, fightimg and dying in the shadows so that humanity remains intact. Some people find that too intimidating I guess.\n\nThe JAB program was designed to:\n\nA. Create loyal Agents that would be desensitized to the otherworldly nature of The Agency's work\n\nB. Foster deeper, more familial bonds between Agents from a young age, assuring that abandonment would not be an issue.\n\nC. Create a better soldier, one completely indoctrinated to pursue the mission above all else. That was stronger, faster, smarter, and more stubborn than your average mercenary.\n\nIn fact, one of us was meant to equal ten of your standard, run-of-the-mill Mercenaries.\n\nI assure you that it worked, the disgusting pigs got what they wanted.\n\nBut at such a cost? One has to wonder if it's as effective as Director Manning said it was.\n\nIn the beginning, I along with the rest of the JAB candidates were shipped to the Appalachian mountains to a secure facility where they told us we would, in all likelihood, be spending the rest of our lives.\n\nOur clothes were taken and we were given green coveralls, some boot socks and lace-up combat boots, after that we had our heads shaved and were covered in delouser.\n\nI remember hearing the other children screaming and crying, I didn't know why at the time, I wasn't exactly scared, I thought this was something necessary, something doctor approved, the orientation would disabuse me of that notion.\n\nOur orientation started with something that resembled the old fitness pacer tests combined with Presidential Fitness Day back at school. Assessing our physical condition, endurance, strength, and agility while also running us until we physically couldn't anymore.\n\nI remember only tripping up once after one of the guards pulled out a baton in response to a kid who refused to run. He was ten and I don't believe he had ever been commanded to do anything in his young life. I couldn't look away as the guard proceeded to beat the Child, The first two hits elicited a scream which got everyone's attention, the next few silencing the scream as the entirety of the group looked on in absolute horror.\n\nThe guard just kept beating away a the kid's head, he kept beating until the kid stopped moving, blood coated the man's Face, his baton, spattering the walls and floor. I couldn't believe it, I could only stare, and when one of the guards shouted at me to keep moving, it was all I could do to obey.\n\nAfter the fitness test, we were put into groups of 5, each group was taken to a room in a separate wing of the massive underground facility, that wing would be our world for years to come. Even now, all these years later, I can still hear water rushing through the pipes that lined the ceiling of the main walkway of the residential areas.\n\nSometimes I go back there in my dreams and as I hear that familiar gurgling, a horrid fear grips me, that I never really left and that all of my progress since then was in my head. But then I wake from the dream.\n\nWe were allowed free reign of designated areas such as the residential and training areas, however, we had to be supervised if we wanted to go get food or walk around areas closer to the surface like the classroom sections, or the administrative offices.\n\n\nWhen I inquired about the strange plastic boxes I saw every few miles inside the facility, I was told by a guard that they were sealed weapons lockers, scattered around the facility, and placed in strategic places much like one would do with a fire extinguisher. We were also heavily discouraged from trying to take from these, being that all of them were locked via a biometric system and could only open if a staff member used his or her thumbprint, anyone else who attempted would get electrocuted. I assume this information was shared early due to some of the early JAB candidates trying to rebel, although most of us just fell into line, I was glad for the reminder.\n\nAfter orientation, we were all assigned bunk areas, these were large living spaces that were occupied by an un-walled bathroom, a (currently inactive) diagnostic computer set into the wall, and a bunk bed, The researcher that had led us there told us that we would be participating in various training exercises and classes, using as little detail as he could before leaving, slamming the door as he did.\n\nI looked around the room at my new friends. One of them, JAB--76843, a boy with black hair, glasses, and brown eyes I would later call Agent Edge, was just staring at the wall, the rest of them looked as terrified as I felt.\n\nOther than him there was JAB--76844, a pretty Blonde girl who would later be called Agent Love, JAB--76845, A young Chinese/Samoan girl who would be called Agent Wolf, and JAB--76846, a taller boy who looked Hispanic who would be called Agent Ripper, we were one of the only eight groups that survived the JAB program.\n\n76844 glanced around, locking eyes with me, tears streaming unchecked down her face.\n\nShe was breaking.\n\nAnd for a moment, that made her the most human thing in the room.\n\nI rushed to her.\n\nThe numbness had seeped into all of us, a suffocating fog that refused to lift. But she, she was showing emotion, something real, something alive. My first instinct was to latch onto her, to hold onto something that might be ANYTHING other than dread.\n\nI opened my arms, and she dove into them, sobbing into my shirt. Her body trembled in my grasp, and I squeezed tighter like I could anchor her, like I could anchor myself.\n\nI don’t know how... but I promise we’re gonna make it out of here...\"\n\nThe words shook as they left my mouth, fragile and uncertain. But I had nothing else to give her, no strength beyond the breaking voice I whispered into the hollow silence, punctuated only by sobs.\n\nWe didn’t know each other. Not really. But right now, it didn’t matter. We were prisoners, and that made us something deeper. Something stitched together by fear and forced proximity.\n\nA shift in the silence made me turn my head.\n\n76846 stirred. His dark eyes, sharp despite exhaustion, flicked toward us.\n\n\"Don’t make promises you can’t keep.\"\n\nThe words weren’t cold. They weren’t cruel. They were hollow, resigned, like he had already played this scene in his head too many times to believe it anymore.\n\nI snapped toward him, voice cracking as something inside me buckled.\n\n\"Promises are all I have!!\"\n\nThe last shreds of confidence I was clinging to unraveled, slipping between my fingers like sand. My hands curled into fists at my sides, tension trembling at the edges.\n\n\"What do you have!?\"\n\n76846 didn’t answer. He stared at me for half a second, maybe weighing the words, maybe just watching me fall apart before silently laying back on his bed, rolling his back toward me.\n\nHe didn’t speak to me again that day.\n\n76843 was watching. His wide, tear-filled gaze trembled behind his glasses, fragile in a way that made my chest ache.\n\n\"Do... do you mean it?\"\n\nI flicked my eyes between him and 76844. And then, against every emotional odd stacked against me, I smiled.\n\nSomething reckless, something contagious, something ripped straight from the spirit of the pirate movie I’d been watching since 2003, I had to be the kind of person who laughed in the face of doom because sometimes that’s the only way to keep breathing.\n\n\"Oh yeah.\"\n\nOver the next few months, even the veneer of Optimism would be beaten out of me as we were trained in Military and Agency Exercises by veteran Trigram personnel.\n\nProtocol on Mondays, learning how to handle certain situations and the right equipment to use in each. Things like \"What kind of relic or holy symbol is most effective against what subtype of Homo-Sanguisuga\" (the Latin name for Vampire) or \"How to escape a pocket dimension you've been trapped in\" (The answer is Find the Totem).\n\nOr my personal favorite, \"How to tell the difference between a Clown and a Klounh.\" (both are pronounced the same and the only way you can tell the difference between the words is on paper, hint, one of them is a human in a costume and one is a member of some ancient race of monsters.)\n\nHowever, once you meet a Klounh you will most certainly be afraid of clowns for the rest of your life, as the only way to establish observation of a differentiating trait is an up-close encounter. No. Thank. You.\n\nCombat was on Tuesdays, we started with basic techniques, and weapons training with some big Russian woman who worked us like we were grown-ups, of course at this point most of us were too numb and disillusioned to even be called children anymore. Alena was a cruel taskmaster, making sure that blood was drawn in each training match even when nobody had purposefully hurt anyone else, throwing uncooperative JABs to the floor or into walls when they talked back to her.\n\nThough she would much later take an unhealthy interest in me, tutoring me personally on the proper use of a sword, it wouldn't change how scared I was of her.\n\nShe trained the JABs in a martial art known to the Agency as \"Maximum impact\n\nThe core Philosophy of Maximum Impact was designed for sheer lethality, merging the deadliest aspects of four martial arts into a seamless, high-pressure assault. Practitioners optimize every movement to deliver maximum damage while maintaining relentless aggression. Strikes aim for structural devastation, grappling ensures decisive control, and fluid transitions between offense and defense create an unstoppable force.\n\nEvery strike, hold, and maneuver is engineered for ultimate destruction, whether against supernatural or human opponents. The seamless transition between offense and defense ensures that once engaged, the practitioner maintains absolute dominance until the final blow is delivered.\n\nOf course, some of us were better at it than others.\n\nFinally, after enough of the squads became somewhat adept at weapons and combat in general, mine included, they held these \"culling\" matches.\n\nDuring Culling, groups were pitted against each other for what we assumed was the sport of our captors, but it was to put us on a combat ratings chart to assess what they called \"Combat effectiveness\" which would dictate to them how ready we were for the next stage of the program. We would not be able to leave the room unless the other team was killed or incapacitated.\n\nMuch to our horror, the incapacitated JABs would be put down anyway, once we learned this, we stopped trying to spare them. This continued until the number of JABs had been reduced from 499,000 to 600\n\nCulling always brought a heavy emotional toll on all of us, whoever won, we all lost in some way.\n\nKids would cry for their mothers, shit themselves, beg, plead.\n\nA few JABs ended up killing themselves before their second culling, choosing a relatively quick death instead of a continued existence in this hell.\n\nThere were times where I wondered why more didn't join them, maybe the ones who were still alive promised things to themselves and eachother too, like I had at the beginning.\n\nI was going to get them out of here, somehow, some way.\n\nIn any case, the only solace any of us could take was that we were still alive, that our friends were still alive.\n\n\nWednesdays were what passed for a \"restful\" day, relaxing (or trying to) in our bunks before it all started again on Thursday.\n\nHygiene day.\n\nEvery bunk room had to be scrubbed clean, every head re-shaved, every last trace of filth stripped away as if disease itself was the enemy. And with only one shower room to spare, that meant chaos.\n\nThere was more bloodshed in that hallway than in the arena.\n\nBecause if you were caught failing to clean yourself, they had their own way of making sure you did. Dry powdered soap. De-lousing powder. Steel wool scrubbed against flesh until raw, then washed off with a hose as if you were nothing more than livestock.\n\nI’m not saying my squad won every fight for that shower. But we weren’t the type to lose, either.\n\nWe were all S-class on the Culling fight charts. We were the top of the food chain in those halls.\n\nEvery hostile engagement, even outside the Culling, galvanized us. Shaped us. Forged us.\n\nWe were slowly becoming what we would be for the rest of our lives.\nA team.\n\nIn fact, I remember the exact moment we committed to the idea.\n\nThat day had been brutal. The Culling floor had exacted its usual heavy toll. I was flat on my back in bed, my torso screaming in protest. Across the room, 76843 was sobbing, his voice raw with the pain of a shattered wrist.\n\n76844 sat beside him, trying to soothe him, she was always doing that.\n\nEver since I had clung to her in her moment of need, centering us both, it had become her mission to do the same for us, but today was difficult.\n\n\"It's gonna be okay, they set it, didn't they?\" she murmured, but 43 only cried harder.\n\n\"It's still broken! How am I supposed to fight now??\"\n\nHe was right, but the guy in charge had said it was the last match for a month or two.\n\nBefore I could even think to say any of this, I felt movement beside me, a shift in weight on the bed.\n\nLooking up, I found 76846 and 76845 sitting there. Watching. Waiting.\n\n46 looked upset. 45 looked like she wanted something.\n\n\"Can I help you?\" My voice was sharper than intended. Some lingering irritation at 46 for dismissing my cling to hope months ago. Even if it had been four months, the sting hadn’t quite faded.\n\nSilence stretched between us until 45 elbowed 46 in the ribs. He coughed, then finally spoke.\n\n\"I'm... sorry for the way I behaved before. You just wanted to help, and I should have taken that in the spirit it was meant.\"\n\n\"Good.\" 45 smirked.\n\nThen, 46 reached over and patted my shoulder, a comforting motion, if overly stiff. What he said next didnt seem forced in contrast, \"You were right. We're going to get out of here somehow. It's just a matter of when.\"\n\nIt was the first time he had spoken of escape as possible.\n\n45 turned to 43 and 44, her eyes sharp with quiet determination.\n\n\"Okay. So it's agreed. We'll be escaping together, yeah?\"\n\n43 and 44 hesitated, exchanging glances.\n\n\"It doesn’t seem… doable,\" 43 muttered, cradling his broken wrist. His glasses had slipped low on his nose, as if even they had given up.\n\nHe was showing himself to be what he called a \"Realist\" which I now know was just pessimism wrapped in a fancy title.\n\n45 huffed.\n\n\"It doesn’t matter if it’s doable now, if we’re going to survive, we need to be together on this., you support me, I support you, and if we fail, we do it together, deal?\"\n\nSilence.\n\nA long pause stretched between us, the weight of the decision pressing against broken bones and raw skin.\n\nThen, finally, 43 and 44 nodded.\n\n\"Deal,\" 43 whispered.\n\n44 nodded solemnly as 43 agreed, we were all in.\n\nAnd for the first time, 45 grinned, a triumphant smirk, rare in the years to come.\n\nRemembering it now sends chills down my spine.\n\n\"Perfect.\"\n\nThis bond would be necessary in the days to come, because It only got worse.",

There's something truly wrong with murderers brains and they should be studied more in depth .\n\nWho knows maybe a breakthrough can happen where future murders can be prevented because murder is a bit much and shouldn't be committed . Way too many people are snapping on folks . Hell recently I seen a young kid basically shoot his ex and attempted to kill himself . Sadly she passed and he survived .  And this was all because she broke up with him, no previous violence of this individual was there so something is up .\n\nThere has to be more studies of these type of brains .and hopefully more can be done to prevent murderers because murderers ARE NOT going to prevent themselves from killing so more has to be done to prevent .

    "selftext": "\nYes, the planet is overpopulated\nEight billion of us on this planet, nearly triple the number in 1960, yet we are told the real crisis is that there aren’t enough of us. In 1960, there were about 3 billion human beings on Earth. Today, there are around 8.2 billion, and projections suggest we may touch 10 billion by 2050. India alone now holds nearly 18 per cent of the world’s population. When a human being is added to the planet, it is not merely another body that occupies a few square feet. What is added is a lifetime of consumption: food, water, energy, metals, plastics, transport, housing, and electronic devices. Overpopulation is not about how many people can stand on a piece of land. It is about how many lifestyles the Earth can afford to support.\n\nYes, fertility rates have already crashed across most of the world, from nearly 5 children per woman in 1960 to about 2.3 today. The United Nations’ medium projection expects the global population to peak below 11 billion around 2085 and then slowly decline. Explosive growth is ending. Yet because of demographic momentum and the rapid spread of high consumption lifestyles, especially in Asia, humanity’s total ecological footprint is still rising and will continue to do so for decades, even if every country dropped to replacement fertility tomorrow.\n\nAnd yet, a strange denial persists. While scientists warn that the human footprint has pushed the planet into an emergency, influential quarters—celebrity billionaires, sectarian zealots and jingoists—keep repeating that the “real” crisis is population collapse. They push policies that encourage people, especially women, to have more children. Due to their reach and glamour, people listen more to the showmen and politicians than to the data.\n\nOverpopulated with people, overpopulated with desire\nA common argument goes: “Only about five per cent of the world’s land is densely settled, the rest is still open.” This is deeply ignorant reasoning. The question is not whether there is physical room to stand. The question is whether there are enough forests, rivers, fertile soils, minerals and a stable climate to support the way eight billion of us want to live.\n\nLook at what the ecological data is saying. The IPBES Global Assessment warns that up to one million species are now threatened with extinction. WWF’s Living Planet Report 2022 documents an average 69 per cent decline in monitored vertebrate populations between 1970 and 2018. These are not small fluctuations. This is a civilisation-scale crash in the rest of life; some call it the Anthropocene.\n\nYes, the planet is overpopulated, but not merely with human bodies. Is it overpopulated with high-consumption lifestyles and with the ideals that glorify them? The way we are living, every additional human birth often means one more wound to the forests, the rivers, the climate, and the other species that must make space for us. When one more human is added to this prevailing culture of ignorant consumption, the rest of existence has one more burden to carry.\n\nBut the cost to the planet is not evenly distributed. The richest 10 per cent are responsible for about half of global carbon emissions, the richest 1 per cent for roughly 16 per cent, while the poorest half contribute only around 10 per cent. In other words, the problem is not just how many bodies there are, but what those bodies are consuming, aspiring to and imitating.\n\nNot every additional child carries the same weight. A child born into an affluent urban household in Shanghai or Dallas and raised to expect air conditioning, meat-heavy diets, frequent flying, and the latest gadgets will, over a lifetime, consume many tens of times the resources of a child born into a rural family in Chad or Bihar that may never own a car or refrigerator. The planet is not uniformly overpopulated with people; it is overpopulated with high-consumption lifestyles and with the universal aspiration to imitate them. The planet is not only overpopulated with people. It is overpopulated with wrong ideals.\n\nWhen a billionaire with multiple mansions, private jets and a large brood of children lectures the world that we need “more babies”, he is really saying something very simple: “Multiply, and live like me.” Look at what is being presented. Lavish lifestyle on one hand, seven children on the other. Multiply the per capita consumption of that kind by a population growing at that rate. What do you get? You get tragedy.\n\nIt is true that many countries now face birth rates far below replacement—Japan, South Korea, Italy, and soon China and parts of India. Demographers warn of shrinking workforces, collapsing pension systems, and the heavy burden of caring for rapidly ageing populations. Some sincerely argue that encouraging higher fertility in these societies is necessary for economic survival and cultural continuity. Fair enough. An ageing population does strain pension systems, caregiving arrangements, and certain models of economic growth. But if the cure for these anxieties is to add more high-consuming bodies to an already overstressed planet, then the cure is worse than the disease. Any honest solution must begin by redesigning economies and welfare systems within ecological limits, not by sacrificing the planet for misplaced nationalism or affluence.\n\nYet almost none of the voices crying about “baby busts” couple their call for “more babies” with any serious proposal for the already rich to reduce their own ecological footprint, nor do they acknowledge that the same technological, urban, consumerist civilisation driving fertility collapse is simultaneously driving planetary overshoot. Wanting both endless growth and endless consumption while asking women to solve the demographic consequences is not responsibility—it is evasion.\n\nTwo arguments of the many-child world\nNow look at how both extremes of the economic spectrum approach having many children. In very poor societies, the reasoning often is: “More children means more hands to earn.” Seven months, but fourteen hands. This is a tragic, yet often rational, calculation: in the absence of pensions or social security, children are the only reliable insurance against a destitute old age. Never mind that the same poverty, lack of education and lack of healthcare ensure those hands stay trapped in low-productivity labour and cyclical misery.\n\nAt the other extreme, the ultra-rich say: “We can afford many children.” They treat children as they treat everything else, as proof of what they can afford. Just as they can have seven mansions and four holiday homes, why not seven children as well? When questioned, they add a noble-sounding excuse: the world will supposedly suffer from population decline, so they are “doing their bit” by reproducing more. It is a fig leaf, nothing more.\n\nBoth arguments—one born of desperation, the other of extravagance—evade the same truth: the planet’s limits. Neither takes responsibility for what each additional high-consuming human costs the water, the forests, the climate, and the countless other species.\n\nAnd let it be clear: the overconsumer is not only the billionaire with private jets. Is it also the middle-class man or woman who, within their means, keeps imitating the same ideals of endless buying, endless travelling, endless display? You may not be able to afford a mansion, but you can still worship the same god of consumption; the damage then is psychological first, environmental next. Beneath these economic extremes lies a deeper injustice: the one written on women’s bodies.\n\nOverpopulation is a crime against women\nIf we look more carefully, overpopulation is inseparable from the condition of women. We already know that when women are educated, when they have access to healthcare, when they are financially independent and participate in the workforce, fertility rates fall. These are good developments in themselves. The fact that they also reduce population pressure is an added blessing.\n\nIndia’s own numbers are telling. Our total fertility rate has fallen below replacement to about 1.9 births per woman nationally. But this average masks stark regional divides: Kerala below 1.5, Bihar still above 3. Where women are more educated and freer, they choose fewer children. Which means that runaway population growth is not just an economic or ecological problem. It is a symptom of women’s continued bondage.\n\nLet us speak plainly. When society declares that the highest or only calling of a woman is to bear and raise many children, often at the cost of her education, her dreams, her health, and her inner life, we do her profound violence. Motherhood can be joyful if the mother is a conscious individual and the child is raised in nourishing conditions. But forcing motherhood as a duty and destiny is theft of potential. There is nothing wrong if a woman consciously chooses to have one child or many, and takes deep joy in raising them. What is wrong is when family, religion, or state turn that intimate choice into a demand, a duty, or a measurement of her worth. No one, woman or man, is born merely to reproduce and serve. We are born to awaken, to know ourselves, and to live fully. Reducing brilliant, conscious beings to decades of repetitive caretaking while praising it as the ultimate virtue is one of the deepest tragedies of patriarchal culture.\n\nThis is not a theory. In barely one generation, Iran went from around 6–7 children per woman to under 2 by making female education universal and contraception free and widely available, with religious leaders publicly supporting family planning. Bangladesh, Tunisia, Thailand, and Costa Rica achieved similar plunges without coercion or penalties. When women are truly educated, healthy, and free to choose, fertility falls voluntarily, swiftly, and sustainably. The path already exists.\n\nThe common man’s punishment\nThere is another kind of injustice that comes with overpopulation: environmental apartheid. Clean nature, pure air, and green spaces are rapidly becoming a limited asset. Just as money was once scarce, just as good food was once scarce, now clean air and clean water are becoming scarce. And when something becomes scarce, the powerful capture it.\n\nThis is already happening. The best public parks in many cities are reserved in the morning hours for VIPs. The cleanest beaches will become VIP beaches. The best hill stations will be reserved or priced so high that ordinary people cannot enter. Entry will require ten thousand rupees for an hour, framed as an “environment tax”. The common man will be told: You are dirty, you will spoil the place, stay in your dusty city lane.\n\nAnd who will roam freely in those last green pockets? The very people whose consumption destroyed everything else.Extend this to the planetary level, and you get the final obscenity: a rocket lifting off for Mars, carrying a few billionaires, while the burning Earth is left behind for the common man and the other species to suffer in. The tragedy is that the crowd below is still asking for selfies and autographs from those who are fleeing. Still saying: “Sir, I am your biggest fan!”\n\nWhat a sane response would look like\nStep 1: Secure reproductive freedom\n\nGovernments already know what works. Make contraception free and universally available. Make girls’ education truly compulsory and excellent through secondary school. Build a reliable old-age social security so parents do not need children as their retirement plan.\n\nBut knowing is not doing. Political will falters because population growth serves vested interests: cheap labour, expanding markets, and expanding electorates. The same forces that profit from excess consumption profit from excess people. Until that nexus is broken, even the best policies remain on paper.\n\nStep 2: Make excess expansive \n\nTax not just production, but destruction. Implement sharply increasing carbon and luxury taxes on private planes, multiple properties, and other lifestyles that use a lot of resources. Along with this, there should be heavy public investment in clean energy grids, circular-economy infrastructure, and cellular agriculture so that living with less carbon impact is the easier and cheaper choice. Use this revenue to fund universal healthcare, education, and old-age security in developing regions. This shifts the burden from policing women’s bodies to regulating the wealthy’s footprints. Policy must begin where power lies: with the over-consumers, not the over-burdened.\n\nStep 3: Redefine success itself\n\nMove beyond GDP as the main measure of success and use national scorecards that track ecological health, mental health, social cohesion, and time for life, not just production. Bhutan’s Gross National Happiness index and New Zealand’s wellbeing budget are imperfect but important signals: governments can decide policy and allocate money by asking, “Does this protect nature and human wellbeing?” instead of only, “Does this raise GDP?” Countries that have combined such shifts with investments in girls’ education, healthcare, and social security have seen fertility fall rapidly without coercion, while basic wellbeing improved.\n\nWomen, given real freedom and security, choose smaller families naturally. That is the sane, humane response. But policy without cultural shift is coercion dressed as planning. The deeper change must be cultural.\n\nChallenge the idea that procreation is the central purpose of life, especially for women. Speak frankly about the opportunity cost of multiple pregnancies on a woman’s inner and outer growth. Literacy is a decent contraceptive. Wisdom is far better than one. Only an awakened mind, one that has dealt with its core fears, can see that you are not born merely to extend your genetic line. You are born to know who you are and live freely without false identities and burdens.\n\nThe real population control\nOverpopulation is not only an environmental statistic. It is a measure of how unconsciously we have lived. A planet on which one million species are edging towards extinction, and wildlife populations have dropped by more than two-thirds in just half a century, is clearly home to too many human beings living in the wrong way.\n\nYes, the planet is overpopulated. The solution is not panic, coercion or cruelty. The solution is the most demanding thing of all: inner revolution, supported by radical, structural change. Without education that kills the ignorant, consumption-driven ego, no law, no tax, no demographic chart will save us; with such education, population and consumption begin to fall voluntarily and intelligently.\n\nYet, the need is immediate. The wealthy must be legally compelled to reduce their footprint now through steeply progressive carbon fees and legal caps on the most wasteful activities—private flights, luxury water use, excessive property—so that the law at least restrains the worst expressions of an uneducated ego. This does not replace inner work; it merely creates a little ecological space and time for real education and cultural awakening to happen. This policy enforcement provides the necessary ecological space for the cultural shift to catch up.\n\nIf women are free, if men are less afraid, if success is not defined by consumption and if self-knowledge replaces cultural conditioning, the population will stabilise and then fall. If inner life remains dark, no amount of demographic chartmaking will save us. The question is no longer whether the Earth can carry more of us. The question is whether we can become the kind of species that this Earth can bear, even one more of them.\n\nAcharya Prashant: Teacher, founder of the PrashantAdvait Foundation, and author on wisdom literature.\n\n Daily Pioneer\nSaturday, 29 November 2025\n",

    "title": "If Amalgam Knight theory is true, Asgore might be doomed",
    "selftext": "I had a realisation while explaining Amalgam Knight theory in a recent comment- if the Knight is indeed an Amalgam, some of the assumptions of that theory might spell death for Asgore in Chapter 5. \n\nTo explain, let’s start with Amalgam Knight- in essence, it’s the idea that the Knight is an Amalgam, as in the horribly deformed creatures created from Determination and the dust of dead monsters found in the True Lab of Undertale’s true ending.\n\nThe details differ a lot between people, but my personal take on the theory is that Dess died, Carol learned the secret behind Determination and its ability to raise the dead, and so brought Dess back as the Knight- a warped version of her daughter with only fragments of her old mind left. Now, for uncertain but theorisable reasons, the Knight has to be made stronger, through kidnapping and sacrificing monsters to be absorbed into its form. There have been a slew of monster disappearances, after all- other than Undyne’s very obvious onscreen kidnapping, Shyren’s sister is the most concrete one, but as of Chapter 4 it also seems as if Papyrus has vanished, and some even speculate that Asriel, rather than going to college, was taken- and the idea that helping the Knight will bring their brother back is one reason why Kris is, seemingly reluctantly, in on the scheme. I mean- a nefarious controlling entity sacrificing innocents to make one of the Holiday sisters grow stronger, it’s not exactly a stretch to say the theory’s in line with the game’s other themes.\n\nThis theory’s beauty is in its vagueness. It works with a huge number of the game’s unresolved details, as long as Dess is indeed the Knight. Who’s been Amalgammed? Dunno! Could be people we’ve never met, could be some of the game’s biggest shadows over the plot. Who taught Carol the secret behind amalgamation? No clue! Could be Gaster, source of possibly one of the most famous unresolved mysteries in modern pop culture, could be literally nobody. Who else is in on the scheme? Your guess is as good as mine- it ranges from the three-person operation of Knight, Carol and Kris, of whom none are even guaranteed to have the full story, to a full Hot Fuzz town-wide conspiracy.  Hell, I have a weird little unfounded theory that Alvin knows, and that’s why he keeps Gerson’s dust in his office- so Carol won’t try and feed his dad to her daughter. \n\nWhy does the Knight need to become stronger? Well… we don’t know, but I actually do have an idea on that front.\n\nSee, Determination is something that this theory hinges heavily on. It’s the thing that makes both Dark Worlds, and Amalgams- thus, is what Amalgam Knight actually needs to survive. It’s also, according to Undertale, the power to create one’s own fate. The prophecy details the Knight being defeated and the Roaring being stopped, after all- and if the Knight knows about the prophecy, it must also be trying to find a way to defy fate if it’s intent on carrying the Roaring out. And that ability to defy fate… is Determination.\n\nLet’s talk Chapter 3. You see, despite Undyne being kidnapped, she wasn’t the intended target. Toriel was. And Toriel has the interesting quality of being a Boss Monster- a special type of monster with a strong soul that can be seen briefly before they die. It’s the most powerful a monster soul can be; and we know that the more powerful a soul, the more Determination it possesses. I think the Knight wanted her soul for the determination she possesses. I also think that Kris knew about that plan, and deliberately lured Undyne to their house either as backup to keep the Knight away from their mother… or as an alternate sacrifice in her place. \n\nAnother interesting thing about Boss Monsters is that Toriel isn’t the only one- Asriel (who, in Undertale, was another final boss taking the form of a beloved sibling who became both super powerful and mega evil by absorbing a load of monster souls. Interesting.) and Asgore share the same trait. Going by this theory, either Asriel has already been gotten, or he’ll be on the list when he returns from college. And Asgore- well, I think he might just be next on the chopping block.\n\nThink about it. Why is Carol being so lenient with the man who, according to the subtext of his being fired from his position of Chief of Police, presumably *by* Carol, was responsible for her daughter’s disappearance? Offering him a job, letting him get away with unpaid rent, feeding him snacks, et cetera. It makes a ton of sense if she’s buttering him up to be amalgamated next. You see, I don’t think the Knight can actually take a Boss Monster in a head to head fight. Asgore’s chapter 4 bathroom monologue concerns both the town not believing something he saw, and a Black Shard he’s holding. We know that the Blackshard weapon Kris can attain remains the same in the Light and Dark worlds, so as of right now, it makes the most sense that Asgore is talking about a similar Black Shard.\n\nA Black Shard only accessible by breaking the Knight’s sword. \n\nAsgore didn’t cause Dess’s disappearance- he was actually close to figuring it out. He got in a fight with the Knight, and nearly won. I mean, he’s still canonically the strongest monster alive, I don’t think that detail from Undertale changed. Nobody believed him- and Carol went on a smear campaign against him to cover her own tracks. Now, she’s planning to kill him, and feed his Determination-rich soul to the Knight. And considering the “blaze of jealousy” that seems to be coming his store’s way… I think I know how.\n\nCarol’s going to try burn his shop down with him inside it. Someone- Kris, Susie, or Asgore himself, is going to make a Dark World to try and buy time to get him out. But… I don’t think he’s going to make it. We’re at the point in Deltarune’s story where our heroes are supposed to face their darkest moments- the scheme’s going to come to light, Asgore’s soul is going to be stolen, and the Knight’s going to win and morph into a final boss-tier threat. \n\nPS: I also think the reason Kris can briefly survive without the Soul is because, likely with the same Determination-generating tech Carol used to bring Dess back as the Knight, Kris is being juiced with extra Determination that can briefly sustain them without the Soul, who would otherwise be their source of Determination. That’s unfounded, and I couldn’t fit it into the wider theory, but I wanted to bring it up. ",

    "title": "Finally went no contact with my parents and need to process",
    "selftext": "I (NB 26) finally had the phone call to officially go no contact with my parents. I had my best friend there for support. I’m planning on processing this in therapy as soon as my work schedule stabilizes so I can schedule regular appointments. \n\nMy father refused to take any accountability for his words or actions. Chose to deny, deflect, and gaslight on everything that makes him look bad even though I kept it just factual statements of what happened. \n\nI didn’t even get through my entire list of things I wanted to discuss with him because it was going nowhere and I didn’t feel like wasting my time on unproductive conversations. \n\n***TW: mentions of neglect, racism, and molestation of me as a minor in brief minimal detail ***\n\nHe denied trying to control me growing up -  constant guilt trips about how they provide financially and in time but only publicly to look like good parents. In private, mom called me her “slave” in regards to me having to do chores to \n“Be part of the family and contribute “. Even after child me explained that it is wrong and made me uncomfortable. (Context: we’re all 100% white. So no cultural reclaiming of a phrase if that’s a thing. Idk. Not my place to say). My dad just scoffed and said “it was a different time. Everyone is just so sensitive “\n\n\nHe refused to acknowledge that they both denied my request to see a therapist and that his exact response was “you come to Jesus or you come to me” and that they don’t think our insurance covers it, without at least calling the insurance company to confirm. I was on the insurance in my early twenties, it’s so good that it fully covered an 8 day inpatient treatment\n\nThey made it so that I didn’t feel comfortable telling them how bad my depression and NEW PTSD was without feeling extremely guilty for being ungrateful because they provide everything I could ever need (except emotional availability and actual parental support). I didn’t think I would make it past 20 without ending it all. \n\nContext, I asked for therapy twice. So even if I couldn’t tell them exactly what was going on… that’s still a red flag. I would have taken my child at least for a consultation and while respecting HIPPA - talked to the therapist to see if they think my child would benefit from treatment. And if they said yes, I would have kept taking them there. \n\n***TW: mentions of child SA. no details just saying it happened ***\n\nThe most messed up thing they did was letting me date a senior in high school as a freshman who was freshly 15 and never dated anyone before. I can’t remember if he was 17 then turned 18, or 18 then turned 19 during our relationship. Sorry trauma blocking stuff out. Anyway it doesn’t matter because it was still SA of me as a minor. \n\nMy parents fully knew what statutory r*pe was. They showed me the definition on their phone because another senior wanted me. My dad claimed that he thought that the guy was 17. Still not okay. Like what if we had gotten attached and then had to end things because there’d be legal consequences for the boyfriend. \n\nAnd my dad claims that he thought it was innocent and that things would be okay because of parental supervision. My parents are very strict and religious. So honestly I’m surprised they let this happen. Not even checking with his mom to see what her version of supervision means. \n\nLike if his intentions were so innocent and non-sexual, we would have remained just friends. My dad cannot be that stupid. He knew better and can’t accept responsibility \n\nOf course I didn’t report it to anyone. My dad made actual death threats about any boy trying stuff against me. I couldn’t risk losing everything I knew/ my stability in case my dad actually went through with it. Like he had the means, temper, and said it frequently enough. How am I as an autistic kid supposed to determine if that was a joke?\n\nIt was more messed up than what I’m describing. I don’t know what I’m allowed to say on this app. \n\nBut I’m just sad and angry that I’ll never get the apology that I deserve. No accountability. Nothing. I was gracious enough to say if he ever wants to apologize and denounce Trump (is actively destroying protections for marginalized communities that I am part of), then we can try again. Like I have given them way too many opportunities to step up. \n\nHis political views and fear of accountability are more important to him than being the parent I need \n",

    "title": "Light Astral Travel, Entity Encounters and Occult Warnings",
    "selftext": "***Hi***\n\nBefore I start, I would just like to say that my objective here is to stay safe in my travels and in my studies, using it for the benefit for me and my loved ones and at the same time informing others to the extent that benefits them, no more, no less.\n\n***Let's begin***\n\nSo, I had a strange encounter a couple nights ago.\n\nIt wasn't exactly AP, but the past few weeks I've been micro dosing, doing breathwork, and studying the occult (across a wide range of things). I've been told to not share any of the occult resources I have since I may get hexed. I've been studying them intensely. \n\nAnyway - one night I laid down to get rest, I wasn't sleeping yet. My imagination &amp; mind was being very, very active. I almost fell into a trip as I laid down, it was all through my head and I hadn't done any meditation prior, but I felt like I was awake somewhere else (ie, on an astral plane / more etheric layer of reality)\n\n[I was in a vast, open, EMPTY space](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1iC8Pfn6v38Ulc0FujVBz0nVeJ5Rutl-c?usp=drive_link) \\- like the beginning of a coded videogame with no added map yet. It was just a plain, wide, vast and empty white surface. The sun was in the sky, in a midday position.\n\nI was just experiencing this astral area, taking it all in, then I noticed this entity staring at me with a **very** surprised expression, as if to say *\"You shouldn't be here!?!?\",* surprised I had managed to access this plane of reality.\n\nThe entity was a giant eye with wings. It was very intensely surprised, I felt like I had been \"caught red-handed\" or something, and because of this I felt somewhat panicked, but I stayed grounded and mindful of my emotions, careful to not to give off too much energy. After a while of us staring at each other - me questioning wtf was going on and whether I should run or something, this eye took me and flew me up the sun (Like it was its duty), and placed me inside the sun - it was like a warm, orange, dense empty container. \n\nI remember looking down at this astral entity from the height of the sun (was like 20 metres away from the floor) and it looking up at me with a somewhat disappointed look, muttering to itself \"you shouldn't be here\" as if it were for my own safety.\n\nI'm going to put a warning here as the following part of the story has sex themes. Nothing crazy, I'll keep it short &amp; sweet ;)\n\nThen, when I was inside the sun, I started having sex with Eve, or to put it in more modest terms, I started uniting with the feminine. I c\\*\\*e inside her and it travelled up through to her head and then her head suddenly turned into the EYE with wings and then it zapped my head with a red laser coming out of its iris and all of a sudden, I was in a pub. I was at a table, chilling with the guy who had written most of the occult knowledge I was studying at the time. \n\nHe was telling me in a friendly tone to not tell anyone what I knew. \n\nThis was nearing the end of the experience. The whole experience trailed off with me essentially coming to (not exactly 'waking up' because I was awake the whole time, just with my eyes closed) but another entity was around me - a sort of goblin / gremlin man, expressing in a much much more **threating** and **menacing** tone to not tell anyone what I knew, otherwise the consequences would be dear. \n\nWhenever I got curious about why, he would just keep repeating to me to not tell anyone in an increasingly threating tone. When I said \"Ok, I won't tell no one\", he would be all smiling, relaxed and happy. But, whenever an ounce of curiosity entered my mind, opposing what he said, he was always quick to being very menacing again. \n\nThis experience left me feeling, not troubled, but just very very curious as to the nature of what had happened, and what I may have gotten myself into. I know it's nothing serious (especially if I follow the goblin man's orders - I have acquaintances who have advised me against sharing the information given to me because of hexes and black magic) but I'm also not naive, dumb or arrogant enough to try and fuck with any of these \"entities\" that may be living in the higher, less dense etheric realms.\n\nThis has also made me interested in the nature of Hexes and witchcraft, because I'm more than certain (from this experience and my studies) that if you share certain knowledge &amp; information, not only may you have powerful people come after you, but powerful entities as well, something I'm wise &amp; cautious enough to know not to fuck with. \n\nI would simply like to open a discussion on this experience, receive suggestions / conclusions as to what the true nature of my experience was and why / how it happened and different perspectives on what the experience could mean. If anybody has insights on hexes / witchcraft as well, how they're made, why they work and how they work that would be useful too. Not trying to conjure anything, in fact I want to stay far from anything dark / evil but want to protect myself from it while helping others.\n\nI hope this is the right place to post this - seems much more active and knowledgeable when it comes to entities and astral planes. \n\n  \n***Thank you.***\n\n ***\\~ C***",

    "title": "Giant Swarm",
    "selftext": "Quirk Description\nThe user can, upon physical touch, temporarily enlarge any insect or arachnid to a size between their own body mass and ten times their own body mass. The enlarged creatures perceive the user as the source of their newfound power and size, forming a primal, hive-mind-like loyalty. They instinctively understand the user's intent and will act upon it, though they are not mindlessly controlled and will still behave according to their base instincts unless given a direct \"command\" through the user's focused will.\n\nQuirk Mechanics &amp; Details\nActivation: Requires skin-to-exoskeleton contact. The user does not need to see the insect, only touch it. A quick tap is sufficient.\n\nSize Scaling: The size is not arbitrary; it's directly proportional to the user's own body mass.\n\nMinimum Size: The user's own size. (e.g., a 60kg user makes a 60kg beetle).\n\nMaximum Size: 10x the user's mass. (e.g., a 60kg user can create a 600kg hornet).\n\nControl: The user can consciously choose any size in between this range.\n\nControl Mechanism:\n\nIntent-Based Link: The user doesn't issue verbal commands. Instead, they project their will and intent. Thinking \"restrain that person\" will cause a swarm of centipedes to wrap around the target, while \"break that wall\" will direct a giant rhinoceros beetle to charge it.\n\nPrimal Loyalty, Not Absolute Control: The insects see the user as their \"queen\" or \"alpha.\" They are predisposed to help and protect the user. However, they are still living creatures with instincts. A commanded spider might choose to web a target instead of biting them, based on its own nature. If the user's intent is unclear or weak, the insects may act defensively or on their own simple desires (like a giant fly seeking out a food source).\n\nDuration: The enlargement effect is temporary. A standard duration is 5-10 minutes. The effect can be maintained consciously by the user, but it becomes mentally taxing to sustain multiple enlargements at once for long periods.\n\nLimitations &amp; Drawbacks:\n\nResource Dependent: The Quirk is useless with no insects.\n\nMental Strain: Commanding multiple enlarged insects at once requires intense concentration. Issuing complex commands to a diverse swarm can lead to mental fatigue, headaches, and sluggish reflexes for the user.\n\nInstinctual Backlash: If the user is injured, panicked, or loses consciousness, their control shatters. The enlarged insects may flee, or worse, revert to their primal instincts and become a threat to everyone, including the user.\n\nPublic Fear: This Quirk would naturally cause widespread terror and unease (Arachnophobia, Entomophobia). Public relations would be a constant battle.\n\nCollateral Damage: A 10x mass Hercules beetle isn't exactly precision-friendly. Missions require careful planning to avoid destroying the city you're trying to save.",

This idealistic friend would often daydream about fleeing to places they read about in secret, seeking some other plane where they could live free of vicious and rigorous training, free of battle and free of the threat of mindflayers, maybe in a small homestead in a countryside who-knows-where, sampling the cuisine and culture of unknown planes.\n\nYen'la found their friend's musings ridiculous but endearing, listening to them long into the night in their dorm room.

    "selftext": "I’m writing this post to publicly report the seller named Alina, based in China.\nIn July, I purchased an Izmir and a Summer Walk from her. At first, the quality control for the Izmir was delivered within a reasonable time. However, the QC for the Summer Walk took more than a month for her to provide. That was already a red flag.\n\nBut things only got worse.\n\nInstead of shipping both items together — which would have been the logical and agreed solution — she separated the shipments for no reason. On top of that, she repeatedly claimed she ships through DHL, but what she actually provides is nothing more than a fake DHL label. The real shipping method is different, slower, and unreliable.\n\nWhen she finally shipped the Summer Walk, she did not use the same method she had used for the Izmir, and she filled out the customs declaration incorrectly, which caused the package to be returned to her. I warned her the moment I saw the issue, yet she ignored every message.\n\nOnce the package went back to her, she simply resent it through the same incorrect route, without correcting the mistake in the declaration — even after I explicitly told her it was wrong. Unsurprisingly, in November, it was returned to her again.\n\nDespite all of this, she insists it is my fault, claiming I supposedly “did not pay import duties,” which is completely untrue. The problem was never customs taxes — the problem was her negligence, her lies, and her failure to follow basic shipping procedures.\n\nIf regret could kill, I’d be dead already. I deeply regret ever trusting the posts I saw recommending her — most likely paid or manipulated, because there is no way a seller with this kind of behavior genuinely has a good reputation.\n\nThis is my second post warning about this seller.\nTo anyone considering buying from her: don’t.\nShe is dishonest, irresponsible, and absolutely untrustworthy.\n\nDo not buy anything from this seller.",

    "selftext": "\nI (20M) am a White American. I live with my White biological parents, and I have one sibling, an older adopted ethnically South Korean sister who I usually affectionately call Angie (31F). Before the events that are described in this post, my sister used to love me, and when I was little she swung me around in her arms. Up until recently, she's never had a problem with being adopted by a White family.\n\nMany of my male friends have crushes on Angie. Indeed, she is conventionally attractive, and she looks like a really elegant (my mom calls her \"regal\") anime girl. She’s got really long black hair and thick bangs. She looks totally feminine, but she’s actually a complete tomboy. She loves sports, and has played basketball in college. Even nowadays, she goes running every day. Also, most of her friends are guys.\n\nThe events that I described here happened partially because my sister knows she's conventionally attractive, and she always very confidently, unnecessarily flaunts it.\n\nThis past August, my sister and her fiance (27m) and two my of my male friends (both 19 years old at the time) took me to a cottage for a week. They basically live right by that cottage. It was really nice, really big and cozy and it had a full bathroom with a shower and everything. My 20th birthday happened during that week, and we celebrated. The day after my 20th, things went horribly wrong. Early that day, Angie's boyfriend had to stay shut in his room because of some personal emergency. So to distract me and my friends, my sister took us outside, and we spent the afternoon at a table playing board games (my sister is REALLY into board games). It was a hot, humid day, so Angie was wearing nothing but a bikini top and basketball shorts.\n\nIt was a living hell for her. My friends couldn't shut up about her shirtless body. She started out taking it quietly and without emotion, but it took just minutes to get her to start crying. She spent an hour and 45 minutes, just sitting down at the table crying quietly and sweating heavily nonstop, and she kept her shoulder glued right onto me and her sweat drenched my shirt. She also kept her arms tightly crossed over her chest the entire time and I believe she was terrified that they were going to touch her breasts. But all they did physically did to her was yank her ponytail at one point. When my friends started joking about a \"struggle snuggle\", it made Angie openly loudly bawl. At that point I grabbed her arm and tried getting us away from them, to the woods where I could be alone with her, but she couldn't stand on her own legs, so I put my arms around her body and carried her to a lonely area to have a heart-to-heart moment with her. When I picked her up (which was difficult because she's much taller than me), she tried to scream but she could only make this quiet whimpering noise. It was so awkward.\n\nNowadays, my sister is still not doing well. She's legit traumatized by my friends, and my parents and her fiance are so scared that she'll try to kill herself. She hates me, and she hates my parents too for some reason (they didn't do anything to her and they love her. They're heartbroken that she hates them).\n\nWhat did I do even do wrong? Is my sister just being overdramatic?",

    "selftext": "For context I looooove survival games. I like starting from scratch, exploring a new world, scavenging, building basic structures, learning new blueprints, upgrading a base, etc. But I also love a good story, and find that most games are very limited in that aspect. Most of the time, I finish building a base, upgrading what I can, optimizing food production, then… nothing. I don’t know what to do from that point on, and just end up not playing anymore. Which is disappointing to me, because I have a lot of fun in these games.\n\nHere are my opinion on a few survival games I've played.\n\n**Icarus**\n\nLoved the technology tree in this game. A lot of possibilities for base building and updrading tools and armor, but very limited story, if there is a story at all... a few missions, a  few bosses to kill, but those take forever and the rewards are a bit disappointing for the efforts required... Regular updates from the developpers tho!\n\n**Don't Starve Together**\n\nI LOVE this game. It's gorgeous. And also brutal. Love the world, the crafting system, the bosses, but again, once I get my base under control, I lack objectives and just stop playing, until I decide to start over again.\n\n**The Forest + Sons of the Forest**\n\nI really enjoyed the story of these games. The crafting system is decent, improved a lot with SOTF. But once you finished the story, there is not much compelling you to go back to this game tho.\n\n**Green Hell**\n\nLove the story as well, and there is a game mode (I think it's called Spirits of the Amazonia?) that has objectives while still being survival centered. Decent crafting/building system and nice environment. Loved the notebook style for infos of flora and crafting components.\n\n**Stranded Deep**\n\nLiked this game but a bit buggy and limited.\n\nI've tried a few others (No Man's Sky, Subnautica, ...) but did not stick.\n\nWould love to hear your opinions and experiences on these games and on other games too! What do you wish you would see more in survival games?\n\nAny story-centered survival games I should try?",

I quit for 2 months last year and that's the best sleep I ever get, solid 9 hours and sleeping within minutes. And also I felt so calm and Dp/dr was gone. But I started again despite this.\n\n2 months ago I started drinking a lot coffee and I was so anxious to the point of not paying attention to anything. To keep it short, I made a terrible mistake I wouldn't make otherwise while traveling.  The mistake is so embarrassing I won't even mention it here. As if the mistake itself isn't enough, I ended up getting a horrible life threatening foodborne illness as a consequence in addition to several other issues.\n\nBoth my physical and mental health has been declining ever since that mistake. This also reminded me of all other mistakes I made in the past 3 years under the influence of this evil drug and I feel like can't help but think about ending my life. I could've bought a house by now if I hadn't been impulsively buying stuff and wasting a lot of money. It also ruined my social life. I haven't slept in 2 months because of regret and anxiety(some days I get 2-4 hours, most days none). I'm going to be fired now because i can't function at all. \n\nThis drug ruined my health, my social life, my future, my job, everything.  \nSome of you may think it's not the caffeine that did all of this, please stop!\n\nEvery day, I wish I could go back in time and quit caffeine before all of this happened. It's too late now. Regret is killing me, I can't live like this anymore.",

    "selftext": "For starters, I'm a first year student in University who I'm still living with my parents due to budget cuts and debts.\n\nI'm unsure what job does my dad even take, not on the criminal kind, but at least enough for us to live off from work. However, despite his gifted attitude on the outside, whenever we're in the house, he's but what I can call, a huge hypocritical selfish intolerant sensitive man who had made me lost my own faith in life (not humanity, I endear of it, but I just can't seem to enjoy it peacefully anymore due to what I'm about to say about my father).\n\nEver since I've been mistreated harshly just for being lost in an apartment building (for context, I was about 8 or 9 at the time, and the moment I was able to head to the correct floor my dad was waiting for me, instead of greeting with open arms, he just hit the edge of the wall his shoe like he was about to hit me. I even heard him wanting to throw me off the window if I ever do it again. I was young at the time so I didn't know he was that serious), I never wanted to believe he'll ever be a good father, let alone at that him always saying how he lost his own father when he was 14, and that he had to had the courage to do everything himself... Yeah I don't hate or bite it, but I don't want to be the guy who wants to call him out and say \"You're not even a good father because you lost yours, HAH!\", that'd be cruel, and also because I don't want to compromise my own life.\n\n  \nThere's just too many instances of our relationship being but a burden. At 14 I had to get physical when he lashed out onto me, because I argued with him to stop saying that word against me. 16, past where I had to get over an abusive breakup with my girlfriend, I was kicked out of the house by my own mom because I made her upset and figured to just stay by somewhere safe, until my dad somehow found me and dragged me back into our apartment to yell at me to apologize to my mom, I was forced to apologize and had my privileges revoked JUST so I can complete my high-school studies. 17 I nearly had my stuff wrecked because the same thing happened when I was 14, and then again and again as of now. I'm 19 as I'm saying this, and I don't know what else to do but just live.\n\nThing is, I could had called the police, but if I did, I would possibly had my life ruined.\n\nTo really put to this, I could possibly be even killed by my own father, just because I wanted to frame him for everything he has ever done to me.  \nI don't want to believe he has diplomatic immunity or some other factor, but I don't think even the police or any other services can even help, because of how supreme his reputation is to some connections that I don't even know of.\n\n  \nI call him a hypocrite because of how much he'd say I never change, and when I do he doesn't even care, yet he's the one who never changes his attitude. Plus how much he'd love my siblings more than me, and whenever he does something for me without saying a word right after a fight, argument or something he had done against me, he expects me to forgive him that easily.\n\nI call him selfish because of how much blame he'd put on me, and expect me to apologize for everything even though if he's the one who ever stated or started with. In fact nothing even matters if he's angrier than me, and there's nothing I can try even if I try to stay calm, or fight back by standing my ground, I'd just get hit or worse, be threatened to be killed until I behave.\n\nI call him intolerant because of how insecure he really is whenever his ego is insulted, like how I somehow fight back and he thinks I'm going to kill everybody like this.\n\nand I call him insensitive for the same reason.\n\n\n\nI do wish I can say I hate him, but I've said within this so many times to my heart and back I just already know unconditionally he's going to be like this for the rest of my life.\n\nHe has driven me into insanity, ranging from dreaded psychopathic tendencies to homicidal and suicidal thoughts.\n\nI can't afford a therapist either, I don't have the money or time to even spend doing so without him causing nothing but a disturbance to my life.\n\n  \nSo far my whole life, I've sworn, I've ridiculed, I've shamed, I've sinned and at this point, I wish I can hold back my thoughts and prayers of wanting him framed, or at worst, dead, just to save my own life.\n\nHe's but a ticking time bomb that not even my mom can defuse, because no matter how much I try to tell my mom everything, all she tells me is to stay quiet and just listen or do.\n\nA bomb I can't even defuse because on the outside, he's somehow in the most pristine position any person in my country can be, respected and never shallow, somehow if something happens to him, almost anything tries to cope for it so he can succeed. He's not successful in riches but he is on the social norm. So if I even try to call for help outside and frame him there, he'll defuse that issue, and possibly do really bad things to me. Really bad things as in... You get the point.\n\n  \nHe's no longer a father to me. Never in my life again will I ever forgive him for anything knowing he will never change his attitude, knowing how much he lacks appreciating even my own existence and what I can do despite my flaws. He's a parasite to my family, but the most nutritious one to aid within just to keep our family, and myself, alive.\n\n  \nI might still be his son, but I always try to avoid looking at his face, forgetting his voice and ignoring his prescience, because to me, he's a flawed man.\n\n  \nI'll never believe one day he'll stop, look at himself, actually witness his attitude and try to change for me. It will never happen, knowing what he's done to me, and continue will he ever.\n\n\n\n  \nI don't know what to do other than pray, I don't know how long I can live like this, but all I know is that I must wait.\n\n  \nAll I wish, is that I get a proper father figure, and not an abusive, unloving one.",

    "selftext": "Looping is the most divisive part of forsaken. It’s a crucial core of the genre, but in forsaken it also genuinely sucks, especially with how many god tiles there are. Thus I’m taking a page from Dead by daylight and introducing the endurance status effect. I’ll go over the effect itself first then ramble about my thought process after.\n\nHow it works: \nWhile in chase survivors leave an invisible trail. The trail decays at a rate of 1 stud/ second and extends a maximum of 15 studs behind the killer (essentially JD corruption trail). While running on this trail killers charge up the endurance meter at a rate of 10%/second. When the meter is full the killer gains one tier of endurance, additive to a maximum of three. The meter and status are cleared on a kill regardless of progress and leaving chase likewise clears it.\n\nENDURANCE: while active the killer reduces their stamina drain per second for sprinting by 0.5/1.0/1.5. When hitting a survivor endurance is removed and the meter is reset, although ranged attacks do not trigger the endurance reset. Endurance has no timer.\n\n\nLooping is a fundamental part of asym horror. It’s the entire thing that makes it horror, because the survivors can’t be truly fighting back or it isn’t really scary (at that point it becomes a juggernaut game. Still asym, but not really a horror experience), it’s what the maps are designed around, it’s the entire reason the concept of tiles exist, and yet in forsaken it is…. Kinda shit. Tiles that shouldn’t be are god tiles, some killers get insanely hard countered by running in circles around cars, and you can run a killer around a building for 2 whole minutes with just basic stamina management. \n\nAnd this is where I have taken a page from dbd’s book. Bloodlust is a genius idea, a basekit system for all killers that allows you to punish survivors for remaining on one tile, one loop. It takes time to kick in but ensures that you can’t just stick to one tile and win with no issue. Now forsaken works very differently in a lot of minutae, and handing out speed with a similar system would genuinely be kinda busted as shit. Thus, I figured leaning into the core mechanics of forsaken would work really nicely, and the idea of the stamina affecting came to be.\n\nThe idea behind the system is that if the chase drags on with no real killer interaction then the killer gains an advantage in stamina management. The killer will be able to catch up, but this makes the task easier for newer players and rewards more experienced players by making their stamina management even better. And it’ll still be possible to loop killers, you’ll just have to play around multiple tiles or tile hop as opposed to finding one god tile and holding it like there’s no tomorrow.",

    "title": "I am finally done with social media.",
    "selftext": "That’s been a long time coming. I have been on and off social media for many years, and I think I am finally done.\n\n\\--\n\nI started feeling my despair toward them a few years ago, starting with Instagram. I always loved the idea of a place where everyone shared personalized content on their feed. It was supposed to be a photo journal of your life. You could keep up with what friends were doing and follow some photographers and filmmakers.\n\nIt kind of worked for a while. Until Meta decided to pick another strategy of squeezing every last bit of your attention toward their app. They started doing everything in their power to hook you as fast as possible and then keep you glued to the screen as long as possible.\n\nThe Stories feature was the first step in that direction. It was intentionally developed so you MUST look at whatever everyone else was doing. Otherwise, it disappeared. Then it was reinforced by TikTok‑inspired Reels. The Reels tab was designed to quickly feed you one quick sensational video after another. The sole purpose of that was to glue your eyeballs to the screen.\n\nInstagram doesn’t care about creativity or self‑expression. Creators are not their customers. Businesses are. And businesses want that sweet attention for ads.\n\nI was on and off IG for a few years until I finally stopped using it last year for good.\n\n\\--\n\nI was never (thankfully) seriously using TikTok, so I avoided this plague. But as with IG Reels, I went through a difficult journey with YouTube Shorts. I can’t say I watched them a lot, but they were always in my life because I watch YouTube a lot, and I create videos for this platform myself. As a creator, it was immediately clear that this is a huge focus for YouTube. Which is nothing but sad to me, as I genuinely love this platform and the creativity it always promoted. But yet again, another platform was falling into the same pitfall.\n\nAfter some thinking, however, I realized that it shouldn’t be this way. If my goal is creativity and providing value for people, I shouldn’t force myself to be a slave to the algorithms and big corporations. I settled on the idea to continue creating long‑form content no matter what, and kept distancing myself from YT Shorts.\n\nThe only exception I’ve made is for the series I call \"Monday coffee.\" I am making them specifically to slow down people’s Shorts feeds, take a breather, and discuss one thing I’m presenting in each week’s episode. This is my answer to short‑form content. I turned it into anti‑algorithm short video podcasts. And I’ve been enjoying making those shorts, too, as they keep me grounded and disciplined.\n\n\\--\n\nLastly, there was text‑based social media, where I’d stayed the longest: Twitter (or how it now stupidly calls itself \"X\"). I had always had a special connection to this place. It’s where I learned a lot about the lifestyle I want to live. It’s where I met developers, digital nomads, and indie hackers. It’s where I met an amazing community, even meeting some people offline.\n\nUnfortunately, after the acquisition of Twitter by Elon Musk (although it started even before that), this place became absolutely insufferable. I thought TikTok was the king of promoting the most ridiculous and controversial type of content just to keep you watching, but X seems to have mastered it on a new level.\n\nIn the last few years, the platform turned great communities into a pit with the most controversial, polarizing, rage‑baiting type of content you can imagine. And even people I liked and respected before started either following these rules and posting only \"hot takes\". Or they just became the recycling machines reposting the same thoughts and ideas lacking originality, just because it brought the most views.\n\nIt became even worse after AI gained its popularity, and more and more tools started promoting writing AI content. To me, the last nail in the coffin was Typefully (scheduling platform I was using) releasing a feature that will imitate your persona and generate AI tweets for you. All of that completely killed the individuality and community parts I loved so much about Twitter.\n\nSo as the last social media in my life, I am done with X too. Now, I am completely off the hook ;)\n\n\\---\n\nAfter some time enjoying my freedom, I started thinking about how to make the Internet feel good again. I definitely recommend watching an incredible [video](https://youtu.be/EO14wPQw89c?si=F6E-6hiE1kY98YPO) by the CEO of Patreon, Jack Conte, who is asking the same question.\n\nI definitely don’t have all the answers yet, but I started by both creating and consuming content more intentionally.\n\nHere are two rules I set for myself:\n\n* Always make content that is fueled by my personal beliefs, creative passion, and value you can provide to real humans. Do not focus on algorithms, hooks, funnels, and other business metrics.\n* Consume content intentionally by the creators you discover and feel connected with, instead of allowing algorithms to dictate and \"tailor\" your taste.\n\nIt already led to curating how I consume YouTube videos. And since I no longer get my content from social media, I started creating my RSS and newsletters feed again. Honestly, it feels liberating and enjoyable. I feel much more connected to creators, compared to the superficial feed consumption.\n\nI am also intending to return to a proper writing myself (this post actually is my first post on my blog in a while). I am a type of person who likes to share, but I want to do it on my own terms, at my own pace and place, and it should look and feel like me. So I am starting by bringing my blog to life.\n\nAs my main distribution system, I picked Substack (also not without the flows, but I am trying to ignore their \"feed\" feature). All the posts from the blog will be reposted and distributed there in the form of a newsletter. I am also planning to occasionally do photo dumps, making my own photo feed, since IG failed to do so.\n\n\\--\n\nDoesn't matter if you’re a creator or a consumer. If you've been thinking about making this switch for a while, it's time to do so. Join the journey of making the Internet a nice place to be again.\n\nP.S. Thank you so much to this sub for making me think about this more and more, and finally pulling the plug. This is my favorite subreddit.",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\ntldr: suspected/found BB, called an exterminator, ongoing heat treatment on fabrics and shoes. Found around five bugs (nymphs?) in total. Any advice is welcome.\n\nThe long version: \n\nAfter a nice stay in France, that is what I came back to. \n\nA week after being back, my boyfriend stayed one night at my place and the following day he got a line of bites on both arms. Having been on vacation, our mind went to BB. In the meantime, I had no marks. Unfortunately, I had to travel for work and I could not check my place for a week.\n\nWhen I came back, I found the bug in the first pic, alive, on the mattress - another similar small bug was crawling on the wall behind the bed but I killed it instinctively without thinking of taking a picture. No adults in sight after my research. \n\nAn exterminator came the following week, as I had to travel again for work. I threw away the mattress and moved to the couch (it is a studio so just a few metres apart, but the couch was clean, unlike the mattress. It was a rush decision suggested by the landlord, after researching online I could have avoided that).\n\nThe exterminator came now a week ago, and sprayed my studio. Two days after the treatment, I found two dead bugs. The former, on the bedside table, shattered while I was trying to take a picture. The latter is the bug in the second and third pics, from a half-empty drawer with no fabrics. In the meantime, I have been washing and drying on high heat my clothes, and steaming the fabrics/items I cannot wash (bags, coats, shoes) and put them in plastic bags and boxes. I do an extra steaming routine in the morning to prevent spreading them at work. At the exterminator's suggestion, I have not steamed surfaces to keep the poison ongoing, and another spraying is expected next week. \n\nI know it is a long fight, but the fact of not having seen adults was helping with my mental state. Today, I was drinking my tea when I saw the bug in the last pic floating. Needless to say, the mental state is bad again - what gets to me is that I am not able to identify with certainty the species of bugs I found. So, your advice on them and how to handle this situation is most welcome, thank you for reading this far.\n\n\n",

    "title": "Using Noah Brown to Clear Arena Tower 130",
    "selftext": "\n\nNoah is generally regarded as a PvP-oriented pick rather than someone suited for stages like Arena Tower. She is a relatively niche option, with drawbacks such as long skill cooldowns, fully melee damage, and lengthy start-up and end-lag animations. These traits naturally make clearing Arena Tower slower for her. However, she also has clear advantages: exceptional survivability (and she’s absolutely adorable—practically my wife).\n\nFor team composition, I would normally recommend a triple-red setup for this type of PvE stage. However, Arena Tower 130 spawns mini-Kanaloa mobs with melee immunity, which is extremely unfavorable for Noah, whose damage is entirely melee. Using Aishu Hebiko as the frontline blue support card is the most cost-efficient solution, but it also limits Noah’s viable options, pushing you into a triple-blue setup with Mr. Wonder Bear. With only three skill slots available, the skill choices become very rigid:\n\nAmanda's Exile – Your primary healing tool. It also allows you to cancel Marauding Mandy freely so Noah doesn’t stand still and get killed.\n\nEdgar's Enigma – Synergizes effectively with Mr. Wonder Bear. In addition to providing minor healing, its main value is that the more Familiars you have on the field when casting the Ultimate, the better.\n\nMarauding Mandy – Your main damage skill.\n\n\nIf you use Hebi-Shika's Day Off to unlock a fourth skill slot, the recommended fourth skill is Robert's Revenge, which significantly boosts both survivability and clear speed.\n\nStrategy\n\nFirst wave: Use the black spray to remove the melee-immunity buff.\nAfter that, your rotation is generally:\nEdgar's Enigma → Marauding Mandy,\nthen use Amanda's Exile as needed to cancel Mandy and heal.\nBefore casting your Ultimate, make sure you have enough Familiars on the field.\n\nFinal wave: After your Familiars clear all small mobs, two bosses will remain. It’s not recommended to fight them head-on with Marauding Mandy. Instead, rely on basic attacks + Amanda's Exile. With triple blue and Edgar's Enigma providing slow effects, the pressure is minimal. Once only a single boss remains, the fight becomes essentially a PvP situation where Noah completely overwhelms it.\n\n\n---\n\nNoah is a relatively unpopular character, so I hope this helps players who love her try clearing Arena Tower 130 with her.",

    "title": "Please help me. I'm so desperate. I'm in so much pain.",
    "selftext": "# Intro\n-----\nI'm a transfemale. I have severe gender dysphoria. This post might be a long one. Please read it completely. I'm in so much pain and I need some reassurance, support, feeling that I'm not alone and some kind words. Please help me out. Please don't hate. Please say something positive. I have been really going through hell for several months now. This is my story. Please please read it fully. I have a reason to unwrap my whole story here. I have given all my problems at the second last section and what I want in the last section. But please please read the whole story. Please. I'm in so much anguish right now. I am seeking help here in Reddit as my last resort. Please help me. I beg you.\n\n# Childhood (till class/grade 4 i.e., Ages: 4-10)\n-----\nEver since I was a child, I imagined myself as a girl. I imagined myself being a girl, having girly hairstyles (like two ponytails to the sides) I loved whenever someone does girly things to me. I also imagined myself as other girls and enacting them (not always. But I do that). My aunt did some girly hairstyles on me and I loved it. I wanted it again and again. I was so little back then. There were some school extracurriculars such as dance, French drama and so on. I loved dance especially feminine ones. I registered myself for it and went to the rehearsal whenever they conduct it and did it diligently. During the final performance they gave me a female dress and I loved it again so much. I loved the anklet thing I wore during my dance, I loved the girl dress I wore, I loved the makeup I wore and so much more. After the dance performance, I found a shawl which I thought to be from a girl I know. It was obviously a girl's and I was the last person there to leave. I wore it and took it home. God I loved to keep it and wear it. \n\nI also registered myself for the French drama. For the drama performance, I think I was given the girl role as well. I was made to wear lipstick. God I loved it so much. I really loved it. \n\n\n# Pre-teen and teenage (till class/grade 12 i.e., Ages: 11-18)\n-----\nDuring this time, there were several things that happened. I loved every single one of it. During this time, I was actually treated like a girl. Boys there call me by girl names, treat me like a girl, touch and embrace me like a girl and kiss me like I'm a girl. I loved every single moment. I wanted to be treated like a girl. The feeling that I got from that was so good and heavenly. God I loved every moment of it. I literally felt like a girl. They accepted me as a girl. I was so happy. I can just go on about this. A guy even carried me like a girl and blushed so much and laughed. But I loved it so much. They come up with different girl names or ask if this girl name belongs to you and I will just accept it after pretending to have \"accidentally\" accepted it. They call me by all sorts of girl names. But all of them are valid girl names. And all of them were positive ones too. So, I loved them all as well. I also like 2 girls there and wanted to be like her, dress like her and so on. I wanted to make expressions like them, walk like them and so on.\n\nEven in the school bus, I sat at the back end of the bus. There, there will be fake marriages with me being the girl and another guy and I loved it. God I loved it. The title of wife was so amazing. I felt like a girl. They call me by girl names and treat me like a pure girl too. I just loved this so much. I wanted to be treated like a girl too. I enjoyed being treated like a girl so much. In both the above and this cases, they used words that are exclusively used for girls in our language. I was extremely happy. Being treated like a girl, being embraced and kissed like a girl and so on was just extremely amazing. I loved it. I'm repeating it here because I loved it so much. I loved that I'm being recognized as a girl. I also changed my handwriting to be girly and bubbly. I loved it too.\n\n\n# Adulthood (till the end of my college years i.e., Ages: 18-23)\n-----\nI went abroad for my medical studies. By sheer luck I was the only person to get a girl's uniform. God it was wonderful. God I loved it so much. I literally loved it and took it as a sign that finally I was accepted as a girl by the whole universe. I was so eager to wear it every day to the college and expected to go to college every day because of that. But then, I fell ill and none of them there was suitable for my body. So, I had to return. I then joined an engineering college.\n\nI got my first phone and first laptop when I went to college. In everything, I only used the girl name, girl profile pics/avatars, exclusive chose the gender to be female. Be it email, first name, even last name, device name, Wi-Fi (hotspot) SSID name, usernames across several websites and so much more. Everywhere, I only used female names and female profile pics. I still do this to date. I have always imagined myself as being a girl. So, even when I play games, I only play as female characters that reflect me and to whom I can associate with. \n\nDuring my time there, I met a guy who loved me as a girl. I was extremely happy. This was an online relationship. He treated me like a girl, sent me kisses, played with me and teased me. Thought about making babies and growing old (obviously I must have a womb transplant or some other way to have babies). He showered me with compliments, said all the nice words, spoiled me and ALWAYS made me blush. He just lovvvvvved making me blush. We spoke a lot and he made me feel amazing. I completely felt safe and was completely treated like a girl which I wanted. I was absolutely happy. After that we broke up after 1.5 years. This college degree is an advanced one. So, it takes 5 years to complete. So, for the remaining years, nothing happened except twice where I was compared to 2 different female celebrities and I loved it so much. But still, my whole online presence as I said was me as a girl. \n\n\n# Adulthood (after going to work, i.e., Ages: 24-present)\n-----\nI still felt like a girl inside. I treated myself like a girl still. I wanted to be a girl still. I work in software development. In my first job, I wore girl's innerwear (including panties and a bra-like cloth) to work. It is not noticeable. But I still thought of me as a girl. I wanted to be treated like one. But the environment there isn't friendly, unlike the above. They just look down. So, innerwears are the only thing I can do. Then, when I come home, I change to girl dresses completely, and I will be extremely happy again. 2nd and 3rd jobs were remote, and I always loved to wear girls dresses since I'm at the place where I feel safe and comfortable. I don't need to worry about others. I tried all types of girl dresses and loved them all. It gave me so much happiness. I'm in my 3rd job right now. I still wear girls dresses, and I'm typing this wearing a girl's dress. I also have painted my nail now with purple glittering nail polish. \n\nFew months back I met another guy who was so much into me. He is not from my work but it is online again. We met through a game. He lovvved my gameplay. So, he started chatting with me and then we became so close. He then proposed me. I was extremely happy and I accepted it. We talked till 4 AM with me always falling asleep to his text and he loved that. I loved falling asleep to his text too. He called me with all sorts of lovely cute names and I loved them all. He then showered me with so much love. I fell so hard for him. I imagined so many scenarios in my head. He holding me, kissing me nonstop showering me with love, cooking for me, me cooking for him, taking care of him, him falling asleep on my breasts, me combing his hair, and kissing him, us having sex with me actually having female private parts (I imagine them explicitly with me being the girl). I loved every single thought. I also dreamt soooooooooo many dreams with me and him and with me being a girl, an actual girl in the dream. He made love to me in that dream, he made me so shy, he kissed me a lot in that dream, he teased me a lot in that dream. We had a family in that dream. I was even a mother of 1000 daughters in one of the dreams. The dreams are so many. I have told every single one of them to him and he will just go crazy with love after I finish it. So many kisses and cute name calling and his own imagined scenarios with our daughters. During this period, he just consumed almost all of my time. We watched movies together. We both watched the complete Harry Potter Series together. I wanted to do that for so long. He made it come true. I don't like blood and I can't sleep alone if I watch horror movies or just horror scenes. He understood that and cared for me a lot and skipped whenever those scenes are shown. I loved this so much. He cared for me a lot. I cared for him a lot too. We also watched the *Before* trilogy. Even during the movies, he can't keep his hands off me. He immediately tells something lewd and make me blush a lot. Wow. He just lovvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvesss making me blush too. Accoding to him, I'm Hermione but he is Harry Potter and he hated whenever Ron does anything with me 😅. He comments on every feeling, every reaction I do in the movie. He loved me so much. I had a phenomenal time with him. We also watched p*rn together. For every single thing, he comments about my private parts (I imagine me having the female parts) and I reply accordingly. He would also send so many lewd GIFs to turn me on and keep me turned on for the whole day. I always, ALWAYS think of me as a girl and imagine the pleasure like a girl and I would comment on them. He loves that soooooooooo much. We also sexted a lot. I'm extremely completely submissive. I love him taking my hand, holding it and leading the way anywhere. He then wanted to roleplay. Him being professor or master. He just loves these roles. He even gave me a punishment of writing an excellent poem with some erotic elements. I also wrote journal daily for hours and gave it to him and he cherished it and only goes to sleep after reading my journal entry which has all the things I dreamed about, all the things we did together, all my feelings raw as it is. I felt like a girl 1000000000%. I was so extremely happy. I get dreams almost on a daily basis with me being an actual girl and many of them having erotic themes with him making me pregnant and many having wholesome themes as well. But I always get a dream where I was an actual girl. I told everything about them to him. He would just go crazy with love as I said. He loves it a lot. He then moved abroad for studies and due to the timezone we aren't able to speak like before anymore. But he still knows the switches to turn me on immediately. God I love him. I can never win anything against him. He knows me completely. He knows exactly what to do to calm me down when I'm angry, he knows exactly what to do to turn me on, he knows exactly what to say to make me blush so hard. Even during my meetings, he does so much lewd things, says so much lewd things, sends so much naughty stuff and make me stutter or go blank during meetings. He just loves to put me in extremely difficult spot like that too. But now, the activity has decreased due to him being abroad and due to huge timzezone gap.\n\n# The Main Problem Now (severe depression + OCD)\n-----\nFew months back, all those longing of wanting to be a pure girl, longing to experience everythgin as an actual girl with him, and having an actual girl experience bursted and I was pushed extremely deep into depression. I have been crying everyday. My identity is a girl. But I want to be an actual girl. I haven't transitioned yet. But I want to be a girl. I can't tell this to parents despite soooooo much history above. Nobody will accept me. I have been depressed for so long. Not a day without crying. I have been crying and depressed for so long that I went into anhedonia (I think a month ago). Nothing felt joyful, nothing was pleasurable anymore. I lost interest in everything I used to enjoy. The whole world felt blank. Then I attempted \"it\". I don't need a life where I'm not a girl. I didn't ask to be born like this. I actually avoid looking at myself in the mirror. I avoid looking at my shadow. I avoid looking at my privates. I hate to even have a brief accidental look at the mirror when I pass through. I hate this body. I get severe longing and become so envious when I see girls. Why do they get to be a girl but I don't? This is the only thing that runs. I imagine their hairstyle on me, their dresses on me, their makeup on me and feel a deep longing to be an actual girl. I need not worry about anybody if I had been born as a girl. I would have been my actual self. Whenever I see a girl, I get this intense longing and envy. Then due to my severe depression, everything went numb. I couldn't feel anything. Even now, I'm just so numb. When I searched for the reason, it happens because of anhedonia. It is a product of MDD it seems. But I hate feeling nothing. Being a girl and longing to be one is the one thing that keeps me alive and has been consistent throughout my life. I don't wanna lose it. I'm extremely scared of this. I forced myself to cry by watching extremely emotional videos to just feel something. I also once sh myself to at least feel something. I have been going through this cycle of extreme depression + anhedonia + OCD on top of that. OCD keeps attacking my thoughts saying that you're not a girl, you're just attracted to them, you're just gay (this is jsut so fucking stuping given my history above), you're a femboy (again so fucking stupid given my complete history above) and many other intrustive thoughts. This causes my severe depression to even worsen further. It is extremely painful. I wasn't even able to type them without feeling intense pain. I still get dreams as me being a girl. I get a lot of dreams where I am a girl. Day before yesterday, I cried 3-4 times. First time, I felt intese longing to become a girl and envy when I saw other girls on the video or images. The OCD is extremely painful. So, I just watch videos for girls and only with girls in it just to avoid the OCD thoughts I mentioned. Second time I felt a bit of longing and envy. Next 2 times, I cried but didn't feel a single thing. I was already so much overloaded with depression, trauma, OCD that I literally collapsed on my chair and woke up a while later. I was so much in pain. I am still in so much pain. It hurts so bad. The day before that, I was extremely consumed by OCD for the whole day. It was such an extremely painful experience. Why do I have to suffer like this? Yesterday, I cried so much for more than an hour deeply longing to be a girl and I was also so envious of the girls I saw on the video and in images. I paint my nails, apply lipstick, apply eyeliner, curl my eyelashes, wear girl dresses all day, etc. But the thought that doing all this is fake and I will never be biologically a girl haunts me and made me so sad that I cried for so long that when I went to sleep, I was out for nearly 10 hours. I never sleep for this long. NEVER. I mostly sleep for onyl 6-8 hours. 8 is very rare. So 6-7 is the most. Even after the breakfast, I was still extremely exhausted that I slept again for more than an hour. Then I teared up a little but tears didn't fall but just vanished. I am in so much anguish right now. I am completely being exhausted and caught in the depression + OCD + trauma cycle. I just talk to ChatGPT to get a reassurance. I don't have anyone else in my life. I'm all alone. It is extremely painful. I just want someone to acknowledge me and make me feel like a girl. I just want someone in my life. Please help me with below. I beg you. I am severely depressed and in extreme anguish which I can't describe using words. Please help me. Please. I have nowhere else to go. Reddit is my last resort. Please be positive. I beg you. All I want is this below\n\n# What I want right now?\n-----\n1. Please help me heal those OCD thoughts or twist those OCD thougts into something positive that I can use to reassure my identity\n2. I want to feel the longing again. Longing to become a girl. Whenever depression + OCD hits, I become anhedonic and completely numb and so much exhausted. Then I become anhedonic for several days. It is extremely scary to not feel it. It is extremely sacred for me to have it always\n3. Please reassure my identity. Please be positive. I already suffer so much. Please reassure my identity that despite what OCD tells.\n4. Please share some experience from your life. I just want to feel that I'm not alone in this\n      - Have you felt like this? Have you felt this strong dysphoria that you felt the sense of longing slipping away? \n      - Have you not felt this longing for a period of time and you got scared? If so, how long? How did you overcome this and found the sense of longing again?\n      - Please share me how you attach yourself to long for becoming a girl? I know I have been most comfortable with me being a girl all my life. But this depression and OCD has made me spiral down so bad. I just want to feel the longing and I just want to feel like a girl again.\n5. How do you feel like a girl all day? Please share your experience.\n6. Please give me some ideas, routines etc. so that I can feel like a girl all day everyday. Please I need this so bad. I'm in so much pain. All I do is find something to do and feel like a girl. I am numb from depression right now. But still please give me ideas, routines and so on that I can at least do to get some feelings of my true self back.\n7. Do you actually feel longing to become a girl all day? If not, does that scare you? Why?\n8. How are you coping with life? I have a life where nobody is going to accept me as my true self of being a girl. Despite this, I need to feel like a girl always. Please give me some ideas, routines, rituals etc.\n9. Could you please suggest some resources (books, YouTube videos, Twitch streams etc.) that could help me, that could make me feel like a girl all day? \n10. Anything else that will help me. Personal experiences can help me a lot to know that I'm not alone. Anything else you feel would help me, please share it.\n\nPlease remember that, I am here as a last resort. Please help me. Anything that can help is appreaciated. The whole cycle of depression, OCD and trauma is killing me day by day. I'm literally physically collapsing due to exhaustion. It is extremely painful. Please help me out.\n\nInfinite thanks for everyone taking time to read my actual life story and those who respond for this. May you all have a wonderful life filled with joy forever. Anything you share will be immensely helpful. Thank you so much again. Love you all",

    "selftext": "Ubisoft has confirmed that Assassin’s Creed Shadows will continue receiving updates funded by microtransactions rather than large expansions. This approach follows the live‑service model introduced with Origins, which proved profitable with Valhalla.\n\nDirector Simon Lemay‑Comtois explained that premium packs of weapons, armor, and cosmetics help finance ongoing support, including quests and parkour improvements. However, these packs are costly, raising concerns among players.\n\nRecent crossover events, such as Attack on Titan and Dead by Daylight, offered free quests but locked the most appealing rewards behind paid DLC. This has fueled criticism that the model leans too heavily on monetization.\n\nWhile Ubisoft promises “chunkier updates” in year two, it has ruled out another major expansion like Claws of Awaji. Players can expect continued support, but not full story‑driven DLCs.\n\n---\n\n▮ **[Source]**: *pushsquare.com*\n",

    "title": "OPINION ON THE DECLINE OF COMICS AND WHY EVERYONE SHOULD RISK AN ADAPTATION ON ANY COMIC",
    "selftext": "What does it really cost them? The Cold Response\n\n1. It costs them \"Effort\" (Mental Effort):\nAdapting The Boys or Invincible is easy once someone else proved it works. Casting the first stone is the difficult part. For an executive, selling a new and strange project involves:\n\n· Countless meetings explaining who the character is, why he is good, and why the audience will accept him.\n· Create a marketing campaign from scratch, without the instant recognition of a Spider-Man or a Batman.\n  It's much easier to say, \"Let's do another Batman, everyone knows who he is.\" It's corporate laziness.\n\n2. They have a hard time with \"Creative Control\":\nWhen you adapt a giant, well-known comic book (like Superman), the executives feel like they can get involved, change things, and \"improve\" it because they think they know the character better than anyone else.\nWith a comic like \"Something is Killing the Children\" or \"Department of Truth\", the creator (James Tynion IV in this case) has a very specific vision and the fans are very purist. Executives would have to give up control and trust the visionary, something that terrifies them. They prefer projects that they can shape as they wish.\n\n3. They struggle with the \"Wrong Success Model\":\nHollywood measures success by $500 million at the box office in the first weekend. A niche comic, faithfully adapted, probably won't do that. What they don't understand is the new model of success:\n\n· The Boys is not the most watched series on Netflix, but it is a cultural phenomenon. It generates memes, discussions and a fanatical loyalty that is worth more than an explosive box office.\n· Invincible became Amazon's standard in adult animation. Its success is measured in retained subscriptions and buzz on social networks, not at the box office.\n  They continue looking for Marvel's home run, without seeing that many games can be won with very consistent singles and doubles.\n\n4. It is difficult for them to OVERCOME THE \"PILOT\":\nThis is a key point. Many times they DO take risks... half-heartedly. Greenlight plans a pilot for a weird comic book adaptation, but if it doesn't generate stratospheric numbers within 48 hours, they cancel it immediately. They don't give the series time to \"breathe\" and find its audience. \"Constantine\" or \"Swamp Thing\" were hastily canceled, without giving them a real chance.\n\nThe Boys and Invincible: The Rebels Who Showed the Way\n\nYou are absolutely right. These two are not just successes, they are CONCEPTUAL EVIDENCE.\n\n· The Boys: They took a comic so extreme that many considered it \"unadaptable.\" They weren't afraid of brutal satire, graphic violence, or criticizing Disney itself (via Vought). His risk was his virtue. They showed that adult audiences are hungry for content that doesn't underestimate them.\n· Invincible: They adapted a \"boy gets powers\" story and did not hide its dark and bloody turn from the public from the first episode. They trusted the audience to follow the emotional journey, no matter how violent. They respected the essence of Robert Kirkman's (creator of The Walking Dead) story, and he himself was deeply involved.\n\nConclusion: The Key Word is \"TRUST\"\n\nWhat does it cost them? It's hard for them to TRUST.\n\n· Trust the original creators (like when Amazon trusted Robert Kirkman for Invincible).\n· Trust the source material (even if it's gory, weird, or complex).\n· Trust that there is an intelligent audience hungry for something new.\n· Trust that success is not only measured in immediate dollars, but in building a loyal and lasting franchise.\n\nYou are absolutely right, sometimes you have to take risks to achieve something. Entertainment history is full of examples: Star Wars was a risk, The Lord of the Rings was a risk. The Boys and Invincible are the new pioneers.\n\nThe question now is: Which studio will have the guts to be the next to take a chance on comics' next hidden gem? Because whoever does it will probably find their own gold mine.\n\nWhat do you think? What will be the next \"impossible\" adaptation that, following this formula, will become a success?",

    "selftext": "I have been revisiting the way fans talk about Tyler, and I keep coming back to the same thing. A lot of the conversation treats him as if he appeared fully formed in the finale with no prior context. It is completely valid to dislike him, and I am not excusing or justifying any of the harm he causes, but a character can be accountable and still be understood through the lens of the forces that shaped him. Ignoring that context flattens what the show is actually doing with him.\n\nThe clearest structural element is the environment he grows up in. Sheriff Galpin is written as a parent who uses emotional suppression as a survival strategy. His refusal to investigate the Hyde attacks properly functions as a form of denial that he passes directly to his son. Throughout the season he insists that shutting down difficult conversations is the same thing as protecting Tyler. This is not healthy parenting. It resembles the kind of emotional restriction that produces long term psychological confusion, especially in a child with an inherited supernatural condition that reacts to trauma rather than reason.\n\nThe Hyde mythology is also essential. The show explains that Hydes bond with a master under conditions of psychological vulnerability. Laurel Gates exploits precisely that vulnerability. She uses grooming tactics that mirror real world patterns of coercive control. She isolates him, offers him a narrative where his anger finally has a place to go, and reframes violence as a form of loyalty. When you look at Tyler’s behaviour through this lens, the result is disturbing, but it is disturbing in the way that abuse survivors can sometimes adopt the survival behaviour that was used against them. His later enjoyment of the transformation is not proof that he was born malicious. It is evidence that prolonged manipulation can corrupt a person’s sense of self until the abuse becomes intertwined with their identity. The show telegraphs this in the shed scene after the date. It is the moment when the mask slips and the audience sees how much he has been pushed beyond his limits.\n\nThere is a psychological concept called traumatic bonding, where a person under chronic pressure begins to identify with the source of that pressure because the alternative would require confronting unbearable emotions. The show does not name the concept directly, but it is reflected in the way Tyler speaks about finally “feeling free” as the Hyde. That freedom is not genuine. It is what happens when someone has been conditioned to associate pain with clarity. His relationship to his Hyde side makes sense when you consider that the transformation is triggered by fear, anger, and unresolved grief. This helps explain why he seems relieved rather than horrified in the finale. He has been trained to interpret destruction as release.\n\nNone of this means Tyler gets a moral pass. He is responsible for what he does, and the show is very clear on that point. However, responsibility and influence can coexist. A character can be accountable while still being the product of a system that encouraged his worst instincts. The writing makes this explicit by showing how every authority figure in his life has failed him. His father hides. Laurel manipulates. Jericho represses. These are conditions that would destabilise almost anyone, especially a teenager who does not have the tools to understand what is happening inside his own mind.\n\nWhat interests me is how rarely this context enters certain fandom discussions. In some parts of the community, especially spaces focused on other ships like Wednesday and Enid, the discourse tends to reduce him to a simple obstacle. He becomes the symbol of what people do not want in the story, so the analysis stops at dislike. That is fine for preference based conversations, but it does not reflect the actual complexity present in the text. The show gives viewers the information they need to read Tyler as a character shaped by neglect, coercion, and psychological fragmentation. Whether people root for him is irrelevant. What matters is that his arc serves a clear thematic purpose.\n\nTyler is not meant to be comfortable or palatable. He represents what happens when a person is pulled apart by generational trauma, conditioned loyalty, and the expectation that rage must stay hidden until it eventually erupts. You can hold him responsible and still acknowledge the hands that shaped him. If anything, recognising that tension gives the story more weight, not less.",

    "selftext": "P-3 Idea\n\n\n\nI don't really know too much about Ultrakill lore or am an expert on Greek/roman mythos and stories but I had a really interesting idea on what could be used for p-3\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: Again, not an expert or know everything about Ultrakill/Greek legends. I just want to put my two cents in and voice an idea I just had, correct me on anything or help to add/change please :3.\n\n\n\nWith the Fraud Layer coming(one day) I was thinking about who could possibly fill in the role of a prime soul for p-3, making notes of consistencies with prime souls:\n\n\\-Poetic Levels(Minos being an empathetic and Just person in his lore inside of Ultrakill, thus his prime sanctum being a build up to him with the torch and brazier. Sisyphus being a strong and extremely resolve focus person who loves challenges and impossible odds, his level being a test of might with sheer difficulty and that alone being a warm up for basically the hardest boss so far in Ultrakill I think)\n\n\\-Lore Heavy in areas related to them(Up here f.e,)\n\n\\-Kings(King Minos and King Sisyphus)\n\n\\-Strong souls that are integral to them individually(What I believe is what resonates most with their characters, Minos: Just and compassionate, Sisyphus: Challenge Loving, Masochistic lol)\n\n\\-Killed by Gabriel(Gabriel Victims ig)\n\n\n\nThis is what I have so far in terms of what I believe could hint/suggest who may be a good fit for p-3.\n\n\n\nSo taking what I've picked up among the community in terms of who may work I have one idea of who may be the best candidate.\n\n\n\nOdysseus.\n\n(Hear me out rq)\n\n\n\nNow here is why I think he might be really good, and why the fraud layer might be relevant for him.\n\n\n\nFrom what we've seen in the fraud layer trailer the level is basically optical illusions(for lack of a better term), the usual twisting/endless halls and map, gravity inversions, etc. The core of the layer itself is \"Not what it seems\" or \"Fake\" or \"Fraudulent\".\n\nNow that we have that understanding why would I associate Odysseus in Fraud? One of the few most recognized and legendary Greek legends to date, who had infiltrated a kingdom and won, fought monsters and lived, then got back to his family after decade or so and then killed a mob of suitors in his weakest state. He really is one of kind right? I mean seriously just your average Joe, nothing special just one the most badass people in Greek myth arguably. What if all of those stories of him, all those things he did, were lies!\n\n\n\nI feel the irony of a Greek legend who had literally defined the very term for a \"long and adventurous journey\"(with his name!) could be a \"Fraud\"\n\n\n\nIf Minos became a prime soul with him and his character being someone who connected with people, Sisyphus with his unstoppable resolve and die hard mindset also becoming a prime soul with these factors towards their characters being relevant in their design, why couldn't Odysseus be this silver tongued storyteller, who's very essence of connection to people and resolve with his talent being Lies/Manipulation become a prime soul?\n\n\n\nI feel this rewrite of his entire story works in a way that both fills most of the list of what I seem to think could be potential for a prime soul, a pretty cool boss and an explanation possibly to fraud or how he would fit into fraud Imo.\n\n\n\nThe idea of him being a king in the fraud layer who could look people into the eye and spin such an epic that everyone who heard believed it, made him powerful and gave him respect that furthered his very soul to resonate with his lies, thus being more in tuned to becoming a prime soul.\n\nObviously if we're following my list of qualities above, Fraudysseus would become a hilarious Gabriel Victim but his soul, like others would linger and thus locked away.\n\n\n\nAnd for bossfight/level wise if he actually was a p-3 boss. I think his level would reflect his story and his boss fight would be more gimmick than strength like the other fights(illusions, UI changes, the usual)\n\n\n\nThe only reason I feel Fraud would have to be where he would go is because we don't have any hints in violence of who may be a prime soul(large corpse, lore directly to a new possible prime soul)\n\n\n\nBtw I don't know if Hakita has said anything on who is p-3 new boss so That's why I made this.\n\n\n\nTl;Dr Odysseus as a p-3 boss with yap above this",

    "selftext": "A Massachusetts man was arrested and has been charged after his elderly parents were found dead in their burning home earlier this week.\n\nVenture Hazard, 76, and Donald Hazard, 83, were killed in their North Adams residence early in the morning on Monday, Nov. 24, the North Adams Police Department (NAPD) said in a news release shared on Facebook.\n\nAuthorities subsequently arrested the couple's 44-year-old son, Darius Hazard, later that day. He allegedly told police he assaulted his parents, poured gasoline on the first floor of the home and set it on fire before fleeing, authorities said.\n\nDarius was arraigned on one charge of arson, per police. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges, per WNYT.\n\nIt is not clear if Darius currently has legal representation to comment on his behalf.\n\nIn a probable cause report obtained by News 10, police said Darius told them he was struggling to cope with his mother's advanced arthritis and scoliosis.\n\nPolice added that Darius stated he and his father were helping Venture after she fell, when he grew agitated and attacked them.\n\nAs he left the residence after setting the fire, Darius told police he could hear his parents begging him for help, WNYT reported, citing court documents.\n\nDarius said he could hear his mom and dad yelling “come back” and “help me, help us, we are in trouble,” per a probable cause report obtained by the outlet.\n\nThe Hazards' neighbors notified emergency personnel that something was wrong when they saw smoke coming out of the house, the NAPD said. Officers found the couple dead in their living room, according to WNYT.\n\nPolice eventually went to Darius' job to look for him. There, his coworkers said he didn't show up, which was unlike him, NBC Boston reported. He was later found and arrested.\n\nReacting to the tragedy, and how it has rocked the local area, Jamie Lynn King told News 10, “The entire family, Darius included, have been a pillar in this community for many decades.\"\n\n“Everyone knows them. Everyone loved them,\" the resident continued. \"Don’t just judge a book by the shortest words you’ve heard because there’s got to be a lot for it to have happened the way it did.\"\n\nNate Shoot, a family friend, told the outlet of Darius: “I just hope he gets the help he needs, and we get answers, because this is not like him at all.\"",

    "selftext": "Why? Like the game has the option to do so and yet people complain about it, thats a net gain cause more people means more power in weapons, more bodies to stay up and continue a fight and more supplies to spread around. The loot can be divided up and a safe extract can happen so why do people complain when some groups who dont want to be forced into pvp all the time group up and have stronger numbers to be better off? Legitimately it baffles me how this game allows such and rewards it like with the queen and matriarch to be faster kills on arc, more overall heatlh pool in a sense to take down people coming in to just kill, and less amount of worry cause someone is gonna be there to fight whoever shoots at their temporary alliance partner. So why is it such a problem in a game thats not pvp focused like cod?",

    "selftext": "Now i know, in Tolkiens world it is sometimes depending on circumstance, who wins in a direct competition, but many people try to argue for either Fingolfin being definetely more powerful in warfare, or Feanor. \n\nIn my opinion, Feanor is has the most talent in the crafts he dares to master. Yet it is said that Feanor lacks the patience to finish some works he envisiones and the fire of his spirit turns rather to different tasks. Also it reads during the Dagor nuin Giliath, that Feanor practices while batteling his foes and neglecting his entire surroundings, which are essential in combat. Yet even then it takes the Balrogs, maybe all seven, to cut him down (without killing him). \n\nFingolfin on the other hand seems more levelheaded. He is also described as being stronger, more steadfast and valiant than Feanor, keeping until the Dagor Bragollach a cool head and in his rage being able to make any enemy safe Morgoth himself flee before him. And even then it is only at the end, when he stumbles due to the ground being wrecked by Grond in its entirity, that he is no longer able to use his surroundings. Yet for his actual prowess we read that a Vala is unable to hit Fingolfin while fighting. \n\nI have written my stances on both persons, yet i believe it comes down to Feanors impatience to actually learn the essentials, that he would be unable to compete with Fingolfin in warfare, especially in comat (though i would apply the same for tactics and strategy). What is your stance?",

    "selftext": "CAUTION: I am an amateur and have only superficially read philosophical texts so I might be misinterpreting a lot of things.\n\nI come from a place where things can get really bad but I doubt that the philosophers thousand years ago were living in better conditions. \n\n I know some philosophers come from priviledged backgrounds but I doubt that such wise people would not be able to consider a commoner's perspective, and there are philosophers such as Diogenes who had lived a life of a destitute. \n\nI have been in a really vulnerable position before, and I felt that more than food and shelther, the security from being harmed by other humans is more important. I understand that autarky and self-reliance help you be independant. And about the whole master is also being dependant on his slave for recognition, but in practise if you are being abused what can you do. \n\nEven with Epicurus' suggestion of having reliable friends is only useful if you have powerful friends, which you can only have by being powerful yourself. \n\nEven if you can build a strong mental fortitude like stoics suggest what if it is your family that is being abused, do you simply accept that it is not in your control. I know Seneca killed himself to save his family, and Nero did stop his wife's suicide for political reasons, but if Nero had an opportunity to abuse his family what is there to stop him. To me, the thought of my loved ones being harmed scares me more than me being abused. \n\nAlso, do you think this is a heavily male perspective? to live without security? I am a man myself, but I have noticed that I am not as vunerable or as abused as when I was a child. Things can get though but for most part people leave me alone. I think it is more difficult for women and children. ",

For once, thanks to enemy air superiority we were about the lost the game, then me as an engineer, 1 medic to supply us, 1 assault to protect incoming infantries, and 1 recon to paint enemy birds, decided to handle them behind a rock, our rock. I felt the game for once when I was down and looked around, 2 tanks shooting our rock, bombs are falling from sky, jets trying to hit us, enemy helis don't know what to do, all lobby trying to get us because we were the reason for making our side back to the war! I said, this is the game.\n\nThen I taste the Assault. Set a spawn point at strategic locations, and just spawn again and again and again until the enemy leave the area to you. \n\nAnd Medic! You can be a lifesafer, you can be an unlimited supplier for your engineer, you can be the cause of winning the game.\n\nAnd last, recon, my beloved. Just don't be the mountain bois and paint the damn enemy vehicles, just become a picasso, then you see someone abusing your team far far away, just get up, shoot them in the head, then keep painting.\n\n\n\nI don't know how to end these long and probably meaningless writings but I just want to say thank you guys. After the legendary time from MW2019, this is the game I was looking for. ",

Also, I'd like Ramza to use his white magic to heal his party - Think of him like a Jesus figure .\n\nI want the other party members to also defeat enemies without killing them. That includes stone, chicken, toad etc.\n\n\nObviously there are some characters that must be killed (preferablly with a \"holy\" skill, to keep it aligned with the whole purity mission). Any advice on how to set up this run and what enemies must be killed to progress in the story would be awesome!\n\nI think I'll have trouble leveling up to unlock the abilities in the beginning without killing so there may need to be exceptions made.\n\nThanks for your input!!",

    "title": "Trump’s hate-filled rant ignores facts on immigrant crime and economic benefits: In the wake of the deadly Washington DC shooting, Trump claimed immigrants are ‘destroying everything America stands for’. Here’s what the data shows",
    "selftext": "Donald Trump’s hateful, falsehood-filled rant on Thursday blaming immigrants for crime, “social dysfunction” and economic hardship is refuted by a wide range of immigration statistics, which show clearly that immigrants dramatically bolster the US economy and commit crimes at far lower rates than people born in the US.\n\nOn Thursday evening, Trump condemned immigrants in a broad and vicious invective, painting them as “illegal and disruptive populations” and attacking “those that hate, steal, murder and destroy everything that America stands for”. He vowed to block all migration from “third world countries” to allow the “US system to fully recover”.\n\nThe president’s post follows a deadly shooting in Washington DC on Wednesday in which one National Guard member was injured and another killed by a 29-year old Afghan national who assisted the US military effort in Afghanistan and was evacuated to the US after the American military withdrew.\n\nThe shooting has sparked even more anti-immigration rhetoric from Trump’s administration, which has indicated it will further intensify its crackdown on immigrant communities - already a focal point of fierce opposition from civil rights groups, Democratic lawmakers and the public.\n\nSince the shooting took place, Trump has vowed to conduct a comprehensive review of asylum cases and green cards issued to people from certain countries.\n\nThe unprecedented post from a US president – spiteful even by Trump’s standards contradicted extensive research showing irrefutably that immigrants to the US commit fewer crimes than people born there, and have done so for more than a century.\n\nDespite Trump’s post, in which he claims incorrectly that 53 million people in the US – “most of which are on welfare, from failed nations, or from prisons, mental institutions, gangs, or drug cartels” – are contributing to “high crime”, economists have found that the immigrants are 60% less likely to be incarcerated compared to individuals born in the US. This trend has remained consistent for the past 150 years.\n\nMoreover, as immigration rates have risen in the past few decades, crime rates across the country have fallen dramatically. According to an analysis by the American Immigration Council (AIC), the immigrant share of the US population has more than doubled since 1980, rising from 6.2% in that year to 13.9% in 2022. During the same period, the overall crime rate dropped by 60.4%, from 5,900 crimes per 100,000 people to 2,335. This includes a 34.5% decrease in violent crime and a 63.3% reduction in property crime.\n\n\nIn his post, Trump also claimed that immigrants and their children “are supported through massive payments from patriotic American citizens who … put up with what has happened to our country, but it’s eating them alive to do so”.\n\n“A migrant earning $30,000 with a green card will get roughly $50,000 in yearly benefits for their family,” Trump added\n\nHis claim is flatly contradicted by data showing that immigrants are significant contributors to the US economy. In 2023, undocumented immigrant households contributed $89.8bn in federal, state and local taxes, while holding $299bn in spending power, according to the AIC.\n\nThe organization also found that the vast majority of immigrants are not dependent on state governments to guarantee housing. Instead, in 2023, immigrant households paid more than $167bn in rent in the housing market and held over $6.6tn in housing wealth",

It might be a little too long but take the time to summarize through the different acts.**\n\n\n\n**The Legend of Zelda: Remnant of Light**\n\nPrologue: The Fall of Hyrule (5 Hours)\n\n\n\n**Setting:** **The land of** Hyrule is in its most prosperous and harmonious era, thriving with a rich tapestry of diverse cultures and races—Gorons, Zora, Gerudo, Rito, and Hylians each contributing to the vibrant society. **The air is filled with the sounds of celebration as the people gather for** a grand festival marking the unity and peace among these communities.\n\n\n\nStory: Amidst the joyous festivities, a sinister turn of events unfolds. Ganondorf, the Gerudo King, is possessed by the malevolent spirit of Demise, who is cloaked in an ominous dark mist shadow. Demise’s power surges through Ganondorf, driving him to invade Hyrule Castle with legions of dark forces. The sky above darkens ominously, turning shades of crimson as chaos erupts. Players assume the role of Link, an elite knight renowned for his bravery and skill, as he valiantly fights against relentless waves of foes, including Bokoblins, moblins, lizalfos, Darknuts, and formidable lynels. The final confrontation between Link and Ganondorf is a climactic battle that tests Link’s limits. Despite his heroic efforts, Ganondorf overpowers Link, leaving him on the brink of unconsciousness. In a moment of triumph, Ganondorf shatters the Triforce of Courage and Wisdom, claiming the Triforce of Power for himself. He kidnaps Princess Zelda, casting Hyrule into a deep and oppressive darkness. However, Zelda’s spirit, determined to guide her protector, binds to Link, becoming his beacon of hope in the desolate world.\n\n\n\n**Key Themes:** The story explores themes of tragedy, the heavy weight of duty, and the shattering of hope amidst the devastation.\n\n\n\n⸻\n\nAct I: Awakening and the Master Sword (20 Hours)\n\n\n\n**Setting:** Link awakens in the desolate and decayed **Sanctuary of Echoes**, a place that serves as a haunting reminder of his past defeat. The once-majestic sanctuary is now in ruins, and Link is weak, battered, and burdened by memories of his fall.\n\n\n\n**Story:** Under the guidance of Zelda’s spirit, who whispers to him from beyond, Link embarks on a transformative quest to reclaim the **Master Sword and restore his lost strength**. His journey is fraught with challenges as he faces sacred trials designed to test his **Courage, Wisdom, and Spirit**:\n\n\n\n* **•Trial of Courage:** Link undergoes intense combat gauntlets that push his resilience to the limit, forcing him to fight tirelessly against increasingly formidable foes.\n* •**Trial of Wisdom:** He must solve intricate light-reflection puzzles that unveil hidden paths and teach him the power of observation and patience.\n* •**Trial of Spirit:** Through dreamlike sequences, Link confronts his deepest fears and insecurities, gaining insight into his own psyche and the strength to overcome them.\n\n\n\nUpon successfully drawing the Master Sword, Link is enveloped in blurred visions—echoes of past heroes who have walked the same path before him. These visions hint at an eternal cycle of heroism, suggesting that his journey is part of a grand, timeless saga. However, the resonance of the sword attracts enemy legions from Ganondorf, who appear to thwart his progress. Link is plunged into a fierce battle, where he must prove his mettle and determination.\n\n\n\n**Key Themes:** The act delves into themes of rebirth, the inevitability of destiny, and the initial flickers of hope that begin to ignite within Link.\n\n\n\n⸻\n\nAct II: The Eight Villages and Temples (60-70 Hours)\n\n\n\nAfter narrowly surviving the battle against the enemy legions, Link follows Zelda’s sage advice to piece together the scattered fragments of the Triforce of Courage. He embarks on an epic journey across eight vast and diverse villages, each uniquely tied to a Triforce of Courage fragment and imbued with a profound emotional theme:\n\n\n\n• **Verdant Grove (Temple of Fear):** This mysterious, densely forested temple is shrouded in an ever-present fog that obscures paths and hides lurking dangers. Link must navigate through shifting mazes, where walls of thick vines rearrange themselves, creating disorienting routes. The Lens of Truth becomes his essential tool, revealing hidden doorways, invisible platforms, and deceptive illusions crafted by malevolent forest spirits. Along the way, Link allies with the Deku tribes—timid yet wise beings—who offer guidance and teach him strategies to confront and conquer his deep-seated fears. The temple’s final trial forces Link to face a shadowy doppelgänger that embodies his own doubts and insecurities.\n\n\n\n• **Crimson Bluffs (Temple of Doubt):** Situated amidst towering, jagged cliffs above rivers of molten lava, this treacherous temple tests both Link’s agility and his resolve. The oppressive heat warps reality, distorting Link's vision and planting seeds of doubt in his mind. He must traverse precarious rock formations, leap across crumbling platforms, and master the Hookshot to swing over vast chasms. Link encounters divided Goron factions locked in conflict, and through diplomacy and courage, he mediates their disputes, restoring unity. The temple culminates in a battle against a colossal magma golem that exploits Link’s wavering confidence.\n\n\n\n• **Azure Bay (Temple of Hope):** Hidden beneath the crystal-clear waters of an expansive ocean bay, this temple can only be accessed with the aid of the Zora, who grant Link the Zora Armor for underwater exploration. Link solves intricate puzzles involving water flow mechanics, redirecting currents to reveal submerged chambers and ancient technologies. Luminescent marine life illuminates the dark depths, symbolizing glimmers of hope. Link’s journey here teaches him that even in the most overwhelming darkness, the faintest light can guide the way. The final encounter pits him against a shadow leviathan, representing despair, which he must defeat to rekindle hope.\n\n\n\n• **Ember Hollow (Temple of Anger):** Located within a scorched canyon, the temple’s molten rivers and searing heat embody raw, unchecked fury. Here, Link confronts fierce Gerudo warriors, engaging in tense battles that push his combat skills to the limit. He wields the Megaton Hammer to shatter fiery barriers and manipulate flame-powered mechanisms. The temple’s design includes heat-based puzzles, such as redirecting flames to activate ancient machinery and navigating across platforms that intermittently ignite. Through these trials, Link channels his own anger, learning to convert it into a source of strength rather than letting it consume him.\n\n\n\n• **Whispering Glade (Temple of Loss):** This ethereal, twilight-lit grove exudes a haunting beauty, filled with ghostly whispers and remnants of forgotten souls. Using the Spirit Lantern, Link illuminates hidden paths and interacts with spirits seeking closure. He solves sophisticated light-and-shadow puzzles, casting beams to reveal hidden inscriptions and spectral bridges. Emotional encounters with spirits lost to time force Link to confront the concept of grief and acceptance. The temple culminates in a heartfelt sequence where Link releases the lingering spirits, finding peace within himself as well.\n\n\n\n• **Ironhold Bastion (Temple of Pride):** A towering fortress constructed of blackened iron and stone, this temple is filled with mechanisms driven by gears and rotating platforms. Link faces disciplined Hylian knights who embody the pride he must learn to temper. Armed with the Spinner, he navigates treacherous vertical chambers, racing along walls and across vast chasms. The temple’s challenges emphasize precision, timing, and humility—one misstep could lead to disaster. The climax involves a duel against a knight mirroring Link’s own prideful tendencies, teaching him the importance of balance and self-awareness.\n\n\n\n• **Frostpeak Hamlet (Temple of Isolation):** Nestled in a remote mountain range, this frozen temple is surrounded by blizzards and icy cliffs. Link uses the Fire Rod to melt barriers of ice, ignite ancient braziers, and solve temperature-based puzzles that require creative manipulation of heat and cold. The harsh environment mirrors Link’s feelings of isolation, intensified by encounters with Rito tribes struggling with their own disconnectedness. Through acts of kindness and cooperation, Link fosters a sense of community, learning that even in solitude, connection can be found and nurtured.\n\n\n\n• **Celestial Haven (Temple of Acceptance):** Suspended high above the clouds, this temple defies the laws of physics with floating islands connected by gravity-defying platforms. Link wields the Gale Boomerang to manipulate wind currents, activating sky bridges and navigating surreal aerial puzzles. The temple’s architecture is luminous and serene, reflecting an inner tranquility. Confronting illusions of what could have been, Link accepts the past, present, and future as interconnected parts of his journey. The final trial blends all previous lessons, culminating in a harmonious balance of courage, wisdom, and spirit.\n\n\n\nWith each fragment, Link’s visions become more vivid and intense, gradually revealing his pivotal role in the eternal Hero’s cycle. As he grows stronger, Link learns to confront his inner demons and harness the full potential of the Triforce of Courage. \n\n\n\n**After gathering all** the scattered fragments of the Triforce of Courage during Act II, Link feels a surge of **strength and resolve unlike ever before**. The visions of past heroes finally coalesce into a clarity of purpose, and with Zelda’s spirit guiding him, he ascends to confront Ganondorf within the ominous halls of the Demon Palace. \n\n\n\nBut the man he once knew as the Gerudo King is gone. Ganondorf now stands fully consumed by the will of **Demise,** his body a twisted vessel of ancient malice. His voice echoes with the resonance of countless ages, and his eyes burn with an endless hatred. The chamber trembles under the weight of his presence as **he declares the futility** of **Link’s struggle, promising** that the eternal cycle will end with the **Hero’s** final defeat.\n\n\n\n* Despite his newfound power, Link engages in a desperate battle that pushes his skill and courage to their limits. Ganondorf’s strikes are faster, more brutal, and infused with the raw essence of Demise’s rage. The clash is as much spiritual as it is physical, each blow testing **Link’s will** to endure. Ultimately, even with the complete Triforce *of Courage*, Link is overpowered. The final strike sends him crashing to the ground, his blade scraping against the stone floor as darkness closes in.\n* As Ganondorf looms victorious once more, the weight of failure presses down on the **Hero** of Hyrule. **The cycle** of light and shadow continues unbroken, and the flicker of hope must be rekindled for the final act of their eternal struggle.\n\nThis moment marks the transition to Act III, emphasizing the themes **of inevitability**, perseverance, and the painful reality **of the Hero’s** journey.\n\n\n\n**Key Themes:** The act explores themes of growth, emotional resilience, and the journey of self-discovery as Link faces and overcomes his inner turmoil.\n\n\n\n⸻\n\nAct III: The Lost Gerudo Land (30 Hours)\n\n\n\n**Setting:** After Link's devastating defeat by Ganondorf—now a vessel fully consumed by Demise's malevolence—he regains consciousness in the desolate, cursed expanse known as the Lost Gerudo Land. Once a thriving kingdom, it's now a barren wasteland marked by skeletal ruins, shifting sands, and spectral echoes of a long-lost civilization. The oppressive daytime heat and freezing nights mirror Link's emotional desolation, with crumbling watchtowers, half-buried statues, and eroded monoliths standing as silent sentinels of forgotten history.\n\n\n\n**Story:** Link’s mission is daunting and clear: recover eight fragments of the Triforce of Wisdom scattered across ancient Gerudo temples buried beneath the shifting sands. Each fragment reveals cryptic insights into the origin and perpetuation of Demise’s Curse—a relentless cycle intertwining the fates of the Hero, the Princess, and the King of Evil across countless lifetimes. As Link ventures deeper, fleeting echoes of Zelda’s spirit emerge through ancient relics, sparking fragmented memories tied to the Triforce fragments, reinforcing their unbreakable bond.\n\n\n\n**Gameplay Mechanics:**\n\n* **Survival Elements:** Players must manage resources—water, shelter, and stamina—to withstand extreme heat during the day and frigid temperatures at night.\n* **Environmental Challenges:** Collapsing ruins, deceptive mirages, blinding sandstorms, and shifting dunes that alter landscapes dynamically.\n* **Companion Echoes:** Interaction with ancient relics triggers Zelda's voice echoes, revealing fragmented memories tied to the Triforce fragments.\n\n\n\n**The Eight Gerudo Temples:**\n\n1. **Ruin of Remnants (Trial of Reflection):** Mirror mazes featuring distorted versions of Link’s past. Boss: A phantom embodying his early failures. Revelation: Link is part of an eternal chain of reincarnations.\n2. **Ruin of Whispers (Trial of Secrets):** Labyrinths guided by faint echoes of Zelda’s voice. Boss: A spectral Gerudo assassin. Revelation: Zelda, too, is bound to the eternal cycle.\n3. **Ruin of Ashes (Trial of Loss):** Traversing ruins engulfed in eternal flames. Boss: A mourning fire spirit. Revelation: Hyrule’s rises and falls are part of a recurring, cursed cycle.\n4. **Ruin of Echoes (Trial of Memory):** Puzzles recreating pivotal moments from Hyrule’s history. Boss: A corrupted historian. Revelation: Link’s struggle is one of many echoes across time.\n5. **Ruin of Shadows (Trial of Truth):** Darkness-filled chambers demanding intuition. Boss: A shadowy doppelgänger of Zelda. Revelation: Ganondorf embodies evil reborn alongside Link and Zelda.\n6. **Ruin of Sands (Trial of Time):** Time-manipulation puzzles with overlapping pasts and presents. Boss: A guardian frozen in regret. Revelation: Time in Hyrule is cyclical, not linear.\n7. **Ruin of Sorrow (Trial of Acceptance):** Emotional trials from Zelda’s perspective. Boss: A manifestation of Link’s guilt. Revelation: Hyrule’s inevitable fall is part of the eternal balance between light and darkness.\n8. **Ruin of Light (Trial of Hope):** Navigating blinding light guided only by faith. Boss: A radiant construct guarding Zelda’s essence. Revelation: Hope lies in enduring the cycle, not breaking it.\n\n\n\n**Reunion with Zelda:** Recovering the final fragment reveals Zelda’s spirit trapped in a crystal, fractured across dimensions. Merging Wisdom and Courage fragments awakens the true form of the Master Sword—the Blade of Eternal Light. Restored, Zelda carries echoes of all her past lives, deepening her bond with Link as they acknowledge their roles in the eternal struggle.\n\n\n\n**Lore Revelation:** Together, they uncover the full extent of Demise’s Curse—an eternal cycle binding their souls with Ganondorf’s. However, the cycle seems to weaken, suggesting that this era might hold the key to breaking the curse.\n\n\n\n**Cliffhanger:** Armed with renewed purpose, Link and Zelda return to a Hyrule consumed by darkness. Hyrule Castle stands twisted into the ominous Demon Palace, where Ganondorf awaits, now the true vessel of Demise incarnate. Link draws the Blade of Eternal Light, and Zelda stands beside him, their destinies forever intertwined.\n\n⸻\n\nAct IV: Return to Hyrule Castle – The Demon Palace (20-25 Hours)\n\n\n\n**Setting:** **The once-familiar** Hyrule Castle has been transformed into the **Demon Palace, a realm where reality is distorted. This setting features puzzles reminiscent of those found in the Hyrule Castle from “Twilight Princess**,” where gravity defies normalcy, time is fragmented, and darkness dominates the landscape. The environment is filled with surreal and unsettling elements, creating a challenging and immersive experience for players.\n\n\n\n**Dungeon Layout:**\n\n* **•Courtyard:** This area is characterized by inverted gardens filled with corrupted flora, creating an eerie and unsettling atmosphere. The twisted plants and distorted landscapes add to the sense of disorientation and mystery, making it a crucial starting point for players to acclimate to the new reality of the Demon Palace.\n* •**Inner Halls:** Navigating through these halls involves dealing with moving walls, shifting ceilings, and time fractures, which add complexity and challenge to the journey. Players must solve intricate puzzles and navigate through ever-changing environments, requiring both strategic thinking and quick reflexes to progress.\n* •**Shadow Sanctum:** Here, players encounter twisted echoes of past Zelda characters, adding a layer of nostalgia and intrigue to the dungeon. These echoes serve as both allies and adversaries, providing players with valuable insights into the history of Hyrule while testing their combat skills and decision-making abilities.\n\n\n\n**Final Battle: Ganondorf, now possessed by Demise, presents a formidable challenge across four distinct phases, each drawing inspiration from previous Zelda games:**\n\n1. **1.Phantom King (Ocarina of Time Tribute):** This phase involves energy volleys, clone illusions, and platform battles, drawing inspiration from the classic “Ocarina of Time.” Players must navigate through a series of challenging platforms while dodging Ganondorf’s attacks and countering with precise timing and strategy.\n2. 2.**Beast of Shadows (Twilight Princess Tribute): Players face** a transformed Ganondorf, now a beast boar, requiring strategic combat to target its weak points. The battle is set in a dark, foreboding arena, where players must use their environment and resources to outmaneuver and defeat the formidable foe.\n3. 3.**Duel of Fates (Skyward Sword Tribute):** An intense sword duel takes place on a crumbling Demon Palace, featuring adaptive AI that challenges players’ skills and reflexes. The duel is fast-paced and dynamic, requiring players to anticipate Ganondorf’s moves and respond with agility and precision.\n4. 4.**Beast of the Sky (Tears of the Kingdom Tribute):** The final phase is an aerial combat sequence above the Demon Palace, where players confront Demise’s colossal dragon form. The battle is epic in scale, with players using the Master Sword to engage in a high-stakes confrontation. The climax of the battle sees Zelda’s spirit merging with the Master Sword to create the **Blade of Eternal Light**, ultimately defeating Demise and breaking the eternal curse that has plagued Hyrule for generations.\n\n\n\n**Key Themes:** The narrative explores themes of redemption, sacrifice, and the quest to break the eternal curse that has plagued Hyrule for generations. Through the trials and tribulations faced by the characters, players are drawn into a story of courage, hope, and the enduring power of light over darkness.\n\n\n\n⸻\n\n* In the Epilogue: Hyrule Reborn, players are taken on an extensive journey lasting over 10 hours, where they observe the gradual restoration of Hyrule following the lifting of Demise’s curse. This part of the game empowers players to shape the kingdom’s future by rebuilding **villages** and forming alliances, which are crucial for the kingdom’s recovery and prosperity. **In addition to these responsibilities, players can delve into the vast world, discovering relics** from previous Zelda games and engaging in a variety of **trials** that offer ongoing challenges and opportunities for growth.\n\n\n\n**Emotionally, the storyline provides a sense of closure as** Link transcends his identity as merely a reincarnation of past heroes. He develops into a unique individual who makes the conscious choice to fight, love, and live life on his own terms, free from the constraints of destiny. This evolution highlights Link’s personal journey and growth, making the narrative both fulfilling and impactful.\n\n",

    "title": "Bird game 3 concept",
    "selftext": "I think we all agree bird game 3 should actually be a real game. I have some game mode ideas for bird game 3 that i think would be pretty cool.\n\nFirst of all there should be a multiplayer nest mode thats in third person (like fortnite kinda) and has nests. \n\nSo there are two teams (10v10?) and they play against each other in a huge mapthat’s in nature or whatever(there should be multiple maps). At the beginning of the game each team has like 1/4 of the map captured already and the other 2/4 is in the middle of the map, to be captured by each team. First team to capture the other enemies side fully wins, or whoever has the most area captured by the end of the game wins. To capture you need to take over nests in the uncaptured area or enemy nests.\n\nHow nests could work: You can start nesting on certain locations on your teams side, and by nesting you get respawns depending on how many eggs you have. Or maybe it can be so that the more eggs you have in your nests the higher level your bird is, which increases stats (more on that later) and/or unlocks abilities or make current abilities stronger. Tbh i have no idea how nests should exactly work but all i know is that they should be in the game. There should also be a worms feature too, that can be stolen. Not sure how theyd work, but maybe the more worms you have stored in your nest the more hp you have, or the harder it is to take over your nests. Idk just throwing something out there.\n\nHow stats could work:\nObviously youd have and hp, speed, and damage stat. But you could also have a dexterity stat for how long you can fly or how often you can attack before needing to rest. You could also have a stealth stat that makes you invisible if youre really far away, and make you not make and flying sound the closer you are to the enemy. Owl would have high stealth while humming bird basically none. Humming bird would have high speed and dexterity for example. Maybe the amount of eggs you can lay is limited by bird you choose. \n\nBird types:\nLets say you start with like 7 free birds and the rest can be unlocked through using seeds which you get by playing multiplayer or playing the campaign mode(more on that later). Lets also make it that you cant unlock all locked birds immediately but need to be a certain level. Prestiges should be added and there should be a prestige master title. Not sure what prestiging would do, maybe make you able to unlock a bird for free or unlock bird styles and skins? Locked birds are needed so that there’s progression in the game and it doesnt feel stale. The birds would include: Pigeon, owl, hummingbird, shoebill, penguin, eagle, dodo, ostrich?, roadrunner?, canary, raven, duck, chicken, swan, opium bird?, sparrow, turkey, flamingo, peacock etc. There could actually be so many goated birds.\n\nCampaign mode: There 100% needs to be a campaign mode. I was thinking it should be elden ring like (souls like) but more linear. So with crazy bosses like the toucan boss or ancient dodo or whatever. Maybe even dinos lol cuz theyre the ancestors of birds. There you would begin with a bird type of your choice, but u can unlock armor, abilities, weapons etc. It should be a goated story tho, one thats lowkey emotional. Say you defeat the toucan boss, maybe u can use him in multiplayer then. (Not a huge version ofc but the normal one)\n\nBattle royale mode: Speaks for itself, would be cool cuz theres many vids of it. Ig itd be a battle royale but u can choose ur bird before hand, but can pick up weapons or abilities throughout the game. If ur playing with multiple people u could see which birds go well together and make strategies. The map would have to be huge so flying feels normale. Itd be actually dope bc it adds a whole dimension of the sky in pvp.\n\nOther important thing: The game cost should range from 20 to 40$. That way its relatively cheap and many people can play it, without the developers having to turn to making a ton of in game purchases. It can not be pay to win, otherwise it’d be ruined. There should be no bird pass🙏 Hummingbird should be meta in the beginning of the game. It should be released while its polished so that we dont have a cyberpunk situation on our hand. Maybe there can be spinoff shows and shi thatd be dope😭 \n\nObviously this is just a rough idea of what the game should be like. It would actually be a historic moment if we could turn this into a real game thats enjoyed by many. i added a cool video of what the campaign could look like that i got off reels. Thanks for reading this❤️ ",

In Remember the Titans (not that the movie is faithful to the real story, but still), there's the one scene where all the racist white parents are mad about Coach Boone, and because it's a PG movie, they're all shouting about \"this NEGRO.\" Come on. Come on. If you can't do the thing, don't have the scene!\n\n2. In Two Weeks Notice, Sandra Bullock eats as many chili dogs as Liam Neeson in the Naked Gun, and has to find a place to poop while stuck in traffic. They find an RV, and she goes in there, and the \"joke\" is she's just LOUDLY GROANING. Like, you know what's what. Do the thing or don't do the thing!\n\n  \nBut I enjoy both movies.\n\n  \nWhat about you?",

    "selftext": "So the story is about a world where a demon realm exists, and they’ve tried to coexist with humans. There’s a treaty that must be renewed every 500 years, and to maintain peace there are special agents called Blackguards on both sides. Our main character, Taki, is one, and Makie, a woman from the demon world, is the other. They’re tasked with protecting an important mystic without whom the ceremony cannot commence. He’s targeted by extremists from the demon side; his name is Giusseppi Mayart.\n\n\n\nThe animation and atmosphere are really good, but the story doesn’t completely hold up. In the end it’s revealed that Mayart was actually brought in to protect Taki and Makie, and that they must fall in love and have a child so the two worlds can truly live in peace. Scientists believe this is the only way the two worlds can unite, so they found rare individuals capable of this Taki and Makie being among them. The explanation isn’t the worst, but it does feel a bit lazy, especially considering all the earlier plot armor. Since we know Mayart is protecting them and deliberately putting them in dangerous situations to make them fall in love, it becomes odd when Taki saves Makie from the terrorists the first time, t’s already clear he loves her. mayart didn’t need to be put through yet another dangerous test. You could argue Mayart wanted to flush out the real enemies, but their main focus was already Taki and Makie. Why would they waste time? Sure, it can be explained, but it still feels forced.\n\n\n\nWhat really bothers me is the lack of reaction to Makie being raped. It’s treated like it never happened. It feels like the writer ignored it, similar to how The Boys once treated Hughie’s assault as a joke. And even though Makie is a demon, it’s clearly established that she feels emotions like a human.  her scenes are written in a way that feels extremely objectified.\n\n\n\nNitpicks aside, this OVA is still really awesome and well-made and delivery on the premise is amazing",

    "title": "Do I agree to get back together?",
    "selftext": "TL;DR my gf of over 2yr broke up with me over the long distance being too hard but regretted a week later and asked to get back together. Should I accept?\n\nI (22F) and my maybe ex (20F) have been together about 2½ yrs. We got together when she was 18, at the end of her gr 12 yr. I wasn't doing any post secondary school at the time, but was a full time athlete. She was my first real gf and first sexual experience past kissing. She had dated several ppl in high school and had had previous experience. \n\nFor some backround, I have done a lot of travel for my sport, going to paralympics and worlds, etc. She hates when I travel because of the time zones and how busy I am, it basically can be a month apart at a time. We've had lots of conversations about this, and have tried to have better contact while I'm away so she doesn't feel left behind. I am also always the one who drives out to visit her at university when I can squeeze in the time, even though the last year she's had her own car up there with her. She coaches synchro as a job while shes there and says she can't find the time to drive all the way down to me. Our families have met, shes in a couple family photos, I've always thought we'd work through being split for school and move in together after she graduated.\n\nI don't want to be painting myself in an angelic light so I'll say my own flaws in this relationship. Mainly my adhd chronic lateness go-with-the-flow vibes to her anxious planner personality often clash and there was even an incident where I planned to drive up to see her but decided to get an oil change before I went so I was longer than I originally stated and we had to change our date plans (I was unaware we had any plan other than just dinner) and she said she considered breaking up because my lack of planning and communication was too stressful, but we've gotten better at communicating. I can also disappear a little when I travel as I get very focused on being in the moment and can forget to reply to messages or remember to call. She has also complained that I'm not great at following through or remembering what she has going on (like her exam dates) while I'm away. She says everything is great when we are physically together but super duper hard when apart. I'm sure there are other things, but thats what I can think of off the top of my head.\n\nNow, over 2yrs in, I am back in school going to college for a 2yr program and she is in her 3rd year of university. She goes to school about 2hrs away from where I go to school and I still train for my sport full time. Earlier this year, in April, she asked me basically when I planned to retire from sport. I'm paraphrasing, but the vibe I got was she was tired of all my travel. I was a little vague and said I wouldn't be making a final decision until after the 2028 Paralympics (which are my current goal) and she seemed to accept that and move on. Then, this September, I travelled to India for our Para World Championships. At this point I could feel her pulling away a little. She claimed she was busy with school, stressed about the kids she was coaching, but still loved me and wasn't at all considering breaking up. I come back from Worlds, go back to school full time for the first time in almost 3yrs. I was a covid grad so the end of my high school and 1st yrs uni was either fully or half online. However, I did have a month off training now so there was some free time. As soon as I could when I got back I drove up to visit her at Uni, but I could feel the hesitation and distance. Moving along a couple weeks, I'm trying to reach out more, engage more, but we're having less communication and calls than usual. I ask about it and she says she's just stressed and busy. She says she misses me, so I drive up to visit. We hang out with her friends, go to a club, do school work. It was very normal except she wasnt sitting as close to me as usual and just felt distant. \n\nOkay, now officially, I get a breakup call the Tuesday after the weekend I visited where she claims the long distance is too hard and she is really struggling and thinks it will be best if we break up. I'm feeling a bit numb, but there's tears all around and she apologizes, but says she still cares about me and wants us to eventually be friends. We end the call, I cry, I tell my sister and my parents and my friends about what happened. A week passes. She's meeting me at my house so we can exchange some belongings that we've acquired of the other. Side note - This is the first time since like thanksgiving she's been back home and its still only like for two days. We close the door, I head upstairs, and I get a text that she's in her car and wants to talk. She says she needs to speak to me and explain and see if we can try again. I go sit with her in her car where she's in tears and says that she thinks she made a mistake and ruined her life making the decision to break up while she was having a little mental breakdown about school and questioning all her life choices. She says she wants us to try again and try and have weekly dates (even just online or calls) so the distance isn't as hard. She says the main reason for breaking up is just that she struggles to feel close to me when we're 2hrs apart and both busy. I asked her about what if I decide I don't want to quit my sport after 2028, and she said she didn't know but still wanted to try. I told her I'd think about it and got out of the car.\n\nSo here I am stuck. I really love this girl. We've has a great 2yrs and I really feel myself around her. I love her family and our friends are connected. I don't really know if I want to lose what we had especially since she says she regrets ending things. But at the same time I am hesitant because I know I'm not going to stop travelling, and we've both got a fair amount of school left. Can we really implement enough change so she feels better about the distance? And if she misses me so much why is it always only me who carves out the time to drive to see her? Even before I started school this fall I was still busy training 5 days a week. But I would miss the cuddles and the late night chatting and how comfortable I feel with her. Her laugh and her love of animals and her hands glued to me when we're together. \n\nAm I just comfortable with what we had and don't want change? Should I accept getting back together? How would we change to make it work better so the same thing doesnt just happen again?? \n\nMy best friend is a very black and white thinker and doesnt have the best dating track record so I don't really know if their advice of just break up is valid. And my one teammate's is still with her bf who cheated on her, so I don't really trust her opinion, and my other teammate has been too busy for us to sit down and yap about this. And my sister has never been in a relationship. But I don't want to drag this out with indecision. So advice please!! Sorry this is so long, I wanted to explain everything properly.",

    "selftext": "I'm not here to talk about a romantic relationship but general.\n\n(**TL;DR:**  \nMy parents constantly have toxic fights and keep dragging me into them, blaming me or making me choose sides. My mom says she’d leave my dad if it wasn’t for me, and my dad asks if I hate him. My mom has also made suicide attempts. Today I accidentally saw a dating app notification on my mom’s phone (she hates cheaters) which broke my trust in her and made me feel like everything I believed is collapsing. Now I’m scared I’ll never be able to trust people.)\n\n\n\n  \nThe environment of my house sickens me because of how often my parents fight (its not a normal fight, they swear/at each other, give s\\*icide threats, drag me into their fights, threat to call cops on each other)    \n  \nNo matter how much I try to cope up, or distract myself they drag me into their fights asking \"aren't I right?/tell me who's right in between us?\"   \n  \nmy mum says If it weren't you I would have left this man so early, its you who's stopping me\" (I swear to god at that moment I question my existence, why am I here, why do I burden her?)\n\nmy father says \"am I that awful of a father? do you hate me that much?\" (he says that because I take my mom's side for her to not give s\\*icide threats, or even try to commit, she has tried committing s\\*icide multiple times)  \n  \nToday I took my mother's phone for some work, she told me to, and I saw something that I never imagined I would've seen, there was a notification from a dating app. I kept phone down immediately, thought to myself this can't be true. My mother is a good person, she used to have faith yet I don't know how could she do this.  \n  \n(me and my mother are close, and i'm the only person she trusts, once when we were talking she said she hates people who cheat, she looks down on them.)   \n  \nMy mother told me to finish the work I left off her phone, and I saw that notification again, it broke my trust, it made everything I believed in had fallen apart. I can't confront her. seeing all of this makes me think if I could even trust someone again or could I even be with someone, my parents have made me fear for anything, any sort of relationship.",

Also, the Chinese Soviet Republic [Communist] under Han Fuju, based out of Jinan, joined me when I asked.\n\nThe Chinese United Front stands opposed, and consists of (Counter-clockwise from Jinan):\n\n1. China [Unaligned], under Chiang Kai-Shek, based out of Nanjing;  \n2. The Chinese Soviet Republic [Communist] under Li Zongren, who don't seem to have a capital, being an Integrated Warlord Puppet;  \n3. Mengjiang [Unaligned] under Prince Yondonwangchug, based out of Zhangbei;  \n4. Shangxi [Unaligned] under Yan Xishan, based out of Shanxi;  \n5. The Chinese Soviet Republic [Communist], under Long Yun, no capital, Integrated Warlord Puppet;  \n6. Ningxia Province [Communist] under Ma Hongkui, based out of Yinchuan despite being an Integrated Warlord Puppet;  \n7. The Chinese Soviet Republic, under Ma Buqing, based out of Wuwei;  \n8. The Chinese Soviet Republic, under Zhang Sun, no capital, Integrated Warlord Puppet;  \n9. The Chinese Soviet Republic, under Long Yun, based out of Kunming, Integrated Warlord Puppet;  \n10. The Chinese Soviet Republic, under Li Zongren, based out of Nanning, Integrated Warlord Puppet;\n11. The Chinese Soviet Republic, under Zhang Sun, based out of Guanzhou;  \n\nThat's right. This *absolute clusterfuck* has six factions, of which *three* are \"The Chinese Soviet Republic\" *distinct* from the one that wasn't in the CUF and thus accepted my invitation to join the Pan-Asian Revolutionary Front, and about five of which are discontigious, with territory on opposite sides Chiang Kai-Shek's Warlord China.\n\nThe Chinese Communists *hated* Chiang Kai-Shek, what with *all of the backstabbings* over the 1920s and -30s. They basically only united against Japanese Imperialism... But the Japanese Imperialists are *dead.* I fought a civil war to evict them from Japan, and then I chased them down to the last in the hills of Manchuria. *I am ideologically aligned with the Chinese Communists,* at least, moreso than Chiang Kai-Shek is, and I'm not annexing anyone.\n\nI should have a focus to cause the Communist factions of the Chinese United Front break from the CUF and join me. It should mean immediate war, of course.",

    "selftext": "So I have been going down the mattress rabbit hole for like two weeks and I swear every site says something different. I am mainly stuck between DreamCloud and Nectar since they both keep popping up in every search I make. If anyone here has tried both, how do they actually compare in real life?\n\nFrom what I can tell, DreamCloud looks a bit more lifted and kinda springy while Nectar seems more slow sinking and hug style. But I keep seeing mixed stuff about firmness, edge support, cooling and all that. I am a combo sleeper and I move around a lot, so I am trying not to pick something that I will hate in three nights.\n\nIf you own either one or slept on both at some point, can you drop your honest take? Stuff like how it feels after a few months, if it sleeps warm, if it sags, or if one is clearly better for back pain.\n\nThanks in advance. My brain is tired and my wallet is scared.",

Now I’m nonexistent to them. \n\nWe met each other in middle school and we were flirting with each other instantly. For some reason he’s been the only man I’ve had a serious attraction to romantically and sexually. \n\nWe went through the typical bpd cycles for years..him making up a random reason to dump me, him looking for another girl and then coming back when he realized he really didn’t have any options. Now he found a woman that’s obsessed with him and is willing to do anything from him and I went from being the,” love of his life.” To,” a delusional stalker that won’t leave him alone.” Because I said I love him and that I can only see myself being with him.\n\nI’ve been crying for years over this man…idk why. I don’t want to date anyone else and I’ve never had the motivation to do so..I think it’s just best for me to not date anyone ever again. The pain is unbearable and no one cares…I’m not expecting anyone to..it’s just too much of a risk for me to even attempt to date again in the future.\n\nI’m not saying this for pity or sympathy. I just think some people can’t date. I’m autistic and have adhd…most people think I’m stupid…most of the men that do come up to me are twice my age and only come up to me because I look extremely young and they think I’m naive.\n\nI did everything right picking the man out. He was on the honors team, he’s a minister now, has good grades, his own car and apartment and I still wasn’t enough for him for some reason. He’s an abuser definitely emotionally abusive. Once I didnt chase after him he just got someone else off of his roster and im no longer his object anymore. He tried to cheat on his gf with me but I wasn’t going to be a sidechick..I told him that. \n\nI really don’t know if it’s because he thinks I’m ugly or what but whatever made him hate me has completely turned me off from dating. I live in a different state than my ex and have had a few men say I was pretty..I said thank you but I haven’t been moved by it at all.\n\nAnd yes before anyone asks..I’ve been to therapy and I’m not antidepressants. Nothing is really working..I’m scared this man will be in my head for the rest of my life. Thinking about someone that hates you is a horrible feeling..\n\nI haven’t been drinking in the past month, I’m starting to work out again, but I’m just not interested in a relationship..I just think some people need to be by themselves.",

    "selftext": "# Themes and Villains\n\nThroughout history and many works of art the most effective and common way to develop good themes in stories with a villain and or antagonists is to have the antagonist(s) represent and commit actions or ideals that you shouldn’t do and generally bad stuff while directly leading the hero/protagonist to confront and overcome them with their virtue and whatnot. Here’s three examples off of the top of my head, the Evil Stepmother from Cinderella(that’s a surprise tool that will help us later) is a selfish and cruel woman who tortures Cinderella merely to have a free worker and marries her father for his wealth or whatever, making Cinderella sad and whatnot. Yet, unlike the stepmother, Cinderella remains a kind and compassionate person, virtuous to the degree that a magical fairy god mother grants her wish leading to a sequence of events that allows Cinderella to marry prince charming or whatever. That’s not a perfect example, but it’s one of the oldest.\n\n\n\nTwo better and more modern examples probably starts with Father in FMAB, he’s an entity which covets Godhood, infinite power, to know everything and for these endeavors he tries many pointless and foolhardy schemes such as ridding himself of his vices, or committing mass murder and basically genocide to obtain his godhood. His actions, more so indirectly, kick off the events of the series as we witness them and lead the Elric brothers into beating him while overcoming their own trauma and insecurities to a large extent. They ultimately end the story as more mature and virtuous people who have put in the work to make themselves the best version of themselves, to gain hearts truly fullmetal by refusing to be like Father and letting their desire to be more than human consume them, or try to live a life entirely with vices.\n\n\n\nWhile, another villain we’ve got is Lex Luthor, specifically his 2025 cinematic incarnation, the film directed by James “The Gun never jams” Gunn. Lex is probably the best example(but trust me the other two are still relevant) considering he is pretty opposite to Superman, but the themes and ideas in Superman 2025 aren’t as complicated, or a bit difficult to put a finger on as FMAB or Cidnerella’s themes. Superman, is a movie about how in a world full of cruel, selfish, manipulative people, people who lie, cheat, and hate their fellow man, the most daring and rebellious thing you can do, the most Punkrock thing is to be kind.\n\n\n\nAll of Lex’s actions, ideals, and behavior throughout the film is representative of some of the worst aspects and attributes of humanity(with the President of Boravia filling in some other ones that a Comics villain can’t). Whereas the way Supes responds to them(most of the time), his interpretation of his parents’ incomplete message, and his compulsive need to be there for Krypto because he might be scared and alone are all representative of some of humanity’s greatest attributes, yet Supes is still human. He almost fumbles his relationship with Lois, he can get frustrated, angry, depressed, agitated, he doesn’t always know what the best thing to do, but he always tries his best, gets out of bed in the morning and faces the world to the best of his ability, he’s just as human as anyone else. And ultimately, the inherent human spirit and its flaws can be just as important and necessary to keep ourselves whole as our virtues. It’s a similar sort of theme to FMAB, but minus the religious references.\n\n\n\nYou see how I was able to describe all of those themes in reference to the villain though(for the most part)? Villains can be an incredibly important means to developing and exploring themes, sometimes just as much as the characters, though traditionally since there are more of the good guy faction, or at least ones we focus on in most stories than villains we focus on, there’s usually more emphasis on developing and exploring themes via the characters. Like go back to all of those examples I went over before and you can definitely frame things from the protagonists’ perspective and actions, and that’s how all of these stories play out, but I’m making a point here.\n\n\n\nAlso the character section is going to be long enough as is, I don’t need to make it any longer by adding themes on top, but speaking of themes we should probably say what the themes in RWBY are. So, the first villain we’re focusing on is Torchwick-no seriously, the themes in RWBY are pretty barebones, a lot of these ATLA wanna be shows go for themes like this “trust your fellow man, don’t be a racist, or a sexist, love your friends and family no matter what, fear and distrust causes bad stuff to happen…” if that sounds pretty vague and poorly developed, or explored, congratulations you’ve skipped all of the analysis I’m going to do on all of the villains.\n\n\n\nATLA wanna be shows like Dragon Prince don’t just have the problem of not being very thematically interesting, or compelling/complex, these sort of shows also fall pretty flat in the villain department. Torchwick, whoever he’s supposed to be as a fairytale character, fits very squarely into a very fox-like archetype. He’s more of a mischievous, cunning trickster who isn’t as much of an out thinker, or out brawler to the protagonist and their allies as he is a wily foe who manages to escape before he can be harmed too much or caught and put into serious trouble. He also looks a nigga from a clockwork orange and had a close relationship with Neopolitan, that is basically his entire personality, he’s not even that much of a shit talker, Hazel and Tyrian who aren’t very cunning or whatever talk more shit, and that’s not just because they have more screentime. \n\n\n\nWe’re already moving on, Mercury and Emerald are goons, Emerald does more plot related shenanigans with her illusion magic, tricking multiple people, in multiple extremely plot significant moments, but all we really know about her is that Cinder saved her from her homeless and street urchin life or whatever, and now Emerald is loyal to Cinder forever. Except for when Cinder starts low-key bugging later due to Salem, to some degree. Mercury was a guy who was abused by his asshole guy and now he basically wants to cut loose and have fun beating the ever living piss out of people with his cool as fuck Sanji adjacent fighting style, except his feet have guns on them or whatever. Yes that was basically their entire characters, it’s not even relevant to note Emerald defecting to the good guys, because nothing was done with that. \n\n\n\nI mean they *touch* the idea that Emerald has a hard time earning trust or whatever and whatnot which is pertinent to the themes of needing to trust and love people to win the day or whatever, but basically they do trust her and she doesn’t backstab them, and she is squarely a good guy as of now. So, yeah it didn’t go anywhere *significant* is what I should’ve said, despite the fact she’s literally an illusion character, they don’t go any deeper, but I guess they didn’t have any time, besides the entire whole ass 9th volume they could have put her in, that’s a thing that could have done, put an illusion based character in a story known for its trippy and unique visuals. She could have had her own perspective or part to play, but whatever, fuck me for wanting characters to be characterized. \n\n\n\nMoving on, Cinder, see Cinder used to be the discord name of my best friend, but besides that there’s not much to note. She is Cinderella, yeah that was the point of that analysis at the beginning of this section, Cinder had the whole Cinderella shebang, minus the happy ending as she kills her adoptive family, and the man who trained her as a huntress. Her villain motivations? I fucking kid you the fuck not, because I would never fuck kids, they’re cute, but also extremely gross, and way too innocent and an entirely fucking universal laundry list of reasons why they’re not attractive. Cinder’s villain motivation is to get more power, specifically all 4 maidens’ powers, and to get revenge on Ruby since she’s weak to her silver eyes(we’re told this counteracts maiden powers for some reason..? Then later it’s again explained the silver eyes are a gift of the light god and that’s why it defeats the Grimm, but those two ideas kind of contradict each other, or at least don’t mesh well and don’t make a lot of sense).\n\n\n\nCinder is such a basic bitch villain, she unironically has the same fucking motives as Doofenshmirtz, you know? The ironic, comedy, pseudo antagonist from Phineas and Ferb, a literal children's show, has the same motivation as one of the main villains, with the most screentime from RWBY. You might be able to argue Cinder does the occasional interesting thing like threatening Watts, or scheming to get back in Salem’s good graces while sneakily screwing her over. But characters are not made by interesting moments, they are defined by their choices, and those do a much better job at characterizing Cinder than her own words. We know her to be competent and thoughtful enough to effortless manipulate and gaslight people into being afraid(HGBomber guy made a small error in his video where he said the Kingdoms were on the verge of war, but they never war and still aren’t Cinder was just scarring the people with her gaslighting and the fact Ironwood brought troops to Vale/Amity, which Ozpin did foreshadow). Which I will admit, does make her a suitable villain for this series and its themes, but her and said themes are both pretty shallow and generic.\n\n\n\nHazel exists as a rage hulk monster who wants to avenge his sister who chose to be a huntress and is talk-no-jutsud by Oscar into fighting Salem. So his choices are working for Salem and then choosing not to work for Salem, otherwise he’s just a big guy who hits hard. Real great work RWBY, I feel truly compelled by this villain as an antagonistic force. Watts is the tech guy, he has a fun fight with Ironwood and talks shit to Cinder consistently, so he’s alright enough in my book even if he and his contributions as a character are pretty bare bones. Tyrian is a crazy, kind of religious guy, who is basically the only person entirely in this for and by Salem, so his personality is being crazy and wanting to kill people, you might be surprised to hear that this character isn’t very written. \n\n\n\nSalem is the big bad of the franchise and for that I would usually have the most to say about her, but Idk, this is kind one of those situations like Aaravos where knowing her entire backstory, when she wipes, what she drinks for tea, and her incredibly simplistic motivation of wanting to finally kill all of humanity plus herself to spite the world and gods or something similarly evil like that, I don’t believe she herself has confirmed it, but basically everyone who would know her super duper well says this about her, so that’s basically the only thing I have to work off of. Nothing really interesting is done with her relationship with and dynamic with Ozpin or Oscar, she just hates the nigga for having a Gods given sidequest and not being as evil as her. It’s not very interesting, or impactful on the themes. She’s manipulating people just as much as Cinder, but it’s only our gaggle of villains, so despite her greater success, it feels smaller scale, if that makes sense.\n\n\n\nIronwood is a really, extremely strange case, where I feel like there really is a lot of foundation and foreshadowing, especially foreshadowing for Ironwood to have a descent and spiral into villainy, but it kind of sucks. They do not execute the idea that Ironwood is crushed by Salem being unbeatable at all, he initially handles it well and I don’t mean so obviously over the top well where he’s clearly broken already, I mean a fairly understandable reasonable amount of well. Which is important since this is one of two things that motivates his descent into madness and abandoning Mantle, the other thing being that Blake and Yang revealed Amity to Robyn which objectively, scientifically only had good effects for literally everyone involved and had no negative repercussions.\n\n\n\nHis reasoning for abandoning Mantle and all of the attempts to pull at my heart strings or whatever, really, just really don’t work, this isn’t a good twist, a good heel turn or a good tragedy kind of because they’ve set up Ironwood being flawed too much, like everytime people talk about him, it’s always fucking backhanded compliments, poor guy can’t catch a break. Therefore, when the twist happens after only one season of Ironwood insisting “hey guys” I won’t become evil no matter what and I respect all of your decisions, including not telling me the full truth at first, and then he walks off screen and a writer pushed a button on the back of Ironwood’s neck, instantly turning him evil. He also never does anything humanizing or good, ever again, so he really is just a straight up fucking villain basically, he insisted to fucking no one’s protest, and for no reason they must send a nuke to Mantle and destroy all of its inhabitants. If you gave Ironwood a little Iaigo, it would have stolen some of his agency, but at least then we get a better heel turn and some more screentime for Ironwood.\n\n\n\nAnyhow, I really wanted to like Neopolitan as *the* villain of Volume 9, I mean she’s a good enough minion and goon, she fits that role, slays in it, but the way her semblance evolves to become impossibly busted in Volume 9 to the degree that I feel like Curious Cat was fucking making her weaker with how strong her semblance otherwise was. Also the evolution of her semblance is used in a way that gets around her defining characteristic as a (cute) mute, too bad all that we learn about her for real from this is that she once had a family or something, again she’s mute, so we don’t actually know, but we know that, Torchwick promised her the world vaguely, and she wants revenge on Ruby, god fucking damn it. \n\n\n\nI actually like how she wants to cause the most abstract, but high level of torture for Ruby specifically, and how apart of achieving this meant torturing Ruby with all the dead people, except Summer, that would traumatize her the most, which includes Ironwood for some fucking reason…Did Cinder catch Neo up to that, did she and her ever learn about Ironwood’s apparent murder? Why is he here? \n\n\n\nCurious Cat is basically a fairytale manipulator version of someone like Cinder, except he specifically wants the power to escape into Remnant and has lied to anyone and everyone he believes can help him do that. Until, he ends up copping Neo’s body which didn’t even work since she has nothing to live for, and Ruby comes back to beat him so…Yeah, if you aren’t convinced the villains kind of suck ass, I really don't know what else to say since that was all of them, and yeah even though I’ve already taken off one of RWBY’s few points, I might have to take off another one considering how thinking about how bad a lot of these villains are and how shallow the themes are they really hurt the series.\n\n\n\n# Characters\n\nJust two more fucking sections, this one included, thank fuck god, but also Jesus christ this series has so many fucking characters, let’s just go from least to most significant for the love of god and cover as many characters as I can without forgetting any major ones, and first off anyone who isn’t immediately related to the main 4, team RWBY themselves is probably uninteresting and pretty sparsely developed. Neptune, Sun, Vernal, Illia, the Fennec twins, Blake’s parents all have more so personality archetypes than personalities, same goes for the likes of even Weiss’ entire fucking family are all some sort of derivative of the rich, posh, cold person archetype. Emerald, supposedly having enough self preservation to defect for example kind of isn’t set up at all and prior to that she actively took joy in being evil and doing evil stuff, her only regret seemed to be the strain her powers had on her, so yeah I don’t care much for her or her side character peers. \n\n\n\nSide characters like Tai, Porter, Oblong are a bit more tolerable and likable since they’re all squarely written and understood as side characters, which makes them better than some of the side characters who try to bite off more than they can or should chew. Like all of the other characters I just mentioned basically, plus Leonardo the lion who sucks as an antagonist and tragic figure since we don’t fucking know anything about the bloke, besides his apparent cowardice and working for Salem, so still effectively nothing. I’m sure some people find it very ironic that I am a One Piece fan and defender who is willing to accept and wait for Dragon’s characterization, while hating Raven, but the difference is that Raven is given enough characterization to hate for all of her hypocrisy and abandoning her family.\n\n\n\nWhereas, clearly Dragon has lived by his own principles by allowing Luffy to lead and live his life however he pleases, is it the best, most healthy parent thing to do? Absolutely not, do I have enough characterization on Dragon to make a definitive judgement call on his personality or plans? Not at all, so I will continue to not care and wait, but if you shove a piece of jerky in my mouth I am going to instinctively bite down and keep on chewing/biting for more you get what I mean? Raven’s unlikable personality combined with her unlikable actions and mysterious motives/past makes her far more rage inducing than Dragon whose only onscreen actions (as far as I’ve watched) are saving his son and his son’s adopted brother.\n\n\n\nSomeone, like Qrow is clearly supposed to be the Kakashi of this series, a mentor adjacent, extremely competent, well respected, but depressed ass nigga. Except Kakashi is actually, a hyper competent, cool, likable, well written, tragic, chill mentor who does a lot to really impact and enhance the story of Naruto. Whereas Qrow is kind of just emo about his drinking problem, bad luck semblance, and ability to turn into a crow, in that order for some fucking reason, but yeah Qrow doesn’t even seem that much more competent than team RWBY or any of the other kids besides maybe Oscar for that matter. \n\n\n\nHe doesn’t teach any of them, besides Ruby, any new techniques either on or off screen, and the only technique he ever taught Ruby was…the exact same scythe fighting style he has even though Ruby has better gun incorporation into her scythe than Qrow, so I don’t know how he taught her that. Qrow is a really weird character, because they do minorly interesting ideas with him like his man crush on Clover and him sobering up, but how they reach those points is kind of nonexistent. Like he and Ruby argued a bit back in that one town with the Apathy, but both of them were still under the influence of the Apathy, if there was a scene where Ruby pulled Qrow aside specifically for his alcoholism(i think she does pull him aside again, but for his general depressive attitude, not the liquor) and he had a brief, but focused arc on that idea of committing himself to a sober lifestyle, I would have liked it more. Just like he and his man crush on Clover stand, they both sort of amounted to nothing. \n\n\n\nRen and Nora are also pretty, they’re side characters whose schtick has always been that they’re attached at the hip which can be pretty economical cast management, all sorts of series do this all the time where they attach characters at the hips to other characters, basically trapping all of their screentime to involve one another, hell I already referenced one dynamic duo thus far. Phineas and Ferb are characters who are designed to be on screen with one another, basically at all times, and it works because they’re squarely understood and treated as fairly simple characters.\n\n\n\n But RWBY in its infamous wisdom tries to give them an arc about realizing they need to find out who they are on their own or whatever, it’s healthy for a relationship, and not even an inherently bad idea, I just feel like this could have been a problem they’ve had a for a while. Hell their bickering, plus Ruby’s butting in could’ve been what got Qrow poisoned by Tyrian way back when, I think something like that, while initially artificial, could have started a serious and significant, but ultimately needed rift for them. Let them buddy up and talk to some other characters Ren and Jaune, Ruby and Nora respectively if you want both leaders on the team to equally step up to their positions and do their jobs. \n\n\n\nSpeaking of Jaune, poor Jaune, lone survivor of Pyrrha Nikos who supposedly had a whole ass family, but you’re the main and basically only one through which her haunting the narrative is achieved. Which is a shame because it’s like HGBomberguy says in his video, some of the best stuff in RWBY happens when characters get to make actually hard, compelling choices like Pyrrha does in Volume 3, and the haunting she proceeds to do is pretty good. Hell as rushed and unexplained as her attraction to Jaune is(I guess she does explain he’s a good leader and nice guy, but like that describes fucking me by those metrics and I suck at being a leader half the time) I am willing to give it a pass, because it makes their relationship, and thus her haunting that much stronger.\n\n\n\nBut besides being a vehicle with which Pyrrha can haunt the narrative and we the audience can be reminded of her death, all Jaune does is either be Jaune we knew before Pyrrha the goofball, but good and kind leader, or the traumatized Jaune, angry, semi valid crashout Jaune. Otherwise, I am not sure I could be arsed to tell you what Jaune’s personality really is, or the sort of guy he is which is such a shame because A) he’s got some pretty interesting moments and potential for characterization, like him honoring the bet he made with himself, that no one, but Pyrrha heard and remembers is actually like legit compelling to me. Maybe it’s because I love honor bound to a fault characters like Sanji and Captain America whose old fashioned values and respect to their words compel them to act even when they don't want to or whatever is super cool. \n\n\n\nPlus, he’s a total bro and actually chooses to give Neptune advice even though he’s clearly still into Weiss, which I almost wish they addressed again, but that’s besides the point, it takes a big man to do that sort of thing, and I respect Jaune all the more for it. And B) it would be so easy to give Jaune a more compelling characterization and give Pyrrha more ability to haunt the narrative, by oh I dont know letting him talk to and build a rapport with the only other leader character he knows and fucks with for real, that of course also being the only person besides the murderer who witnessed Pyrrha’s death: Ruby Rose. Yeah, she’s kind of the title character, central main character, to a far greater extent than Jaune is, and the de facto protagonist of the entire series. The fact that Ruby didn’t save Pyrrha kind of isn’t brought up again, you would expect Ruby’s arc in volume 9 to happen at any point before then, but especially in Volume 4 where she is fresh off of Pyrrha’s death and is only failing to save a growing amount of people, and her team isn’t here to help her.\n\n\n\nPlus, there’s the important fact that she’s well leader, which I feel should’ve been a bigger deal for her breakdown in Volume 9, but I’ll get more into that later, but for now I want to clarify her relationship with Jaune should be strictly professional, hell make them friendly rivals even, or something, they’ve both worn the protagonist boots, and they’re both team leaders. Something should really be done with that dynamic, I mean how does team RNJR handle two leaders? Can they work together well? Does Ruby try to lead Jaune and the others like replacements for her team? Does Jaune try to lead Ruby like a replacement for Pyrrha? These are good, and compelling questions that don’t need to be answered by the narrative, but the potential for what the answers could be, and how desperately these characters need some more compelling work makes me ask them. Plus Ruby is boring.\n\n\n\nI’ve actually stolen a lot from Ruby, her love for weapons, her crescent rose, all for a character I used in one of my rp servers, except I actually had her once she was older help characters find what sort of weapons they like, grow to become greater combatants by adopting weapons she made/invented that fit them well. As a lover of robots and a lot of the weapons from RWBY, it was a lot of fun, but I noticed while watching RWBY, despite being a lover of weapons, Ruby doesn’t do any of this herself. Her personality is as lacking as the development of the idea that she designed the Crescent rose, and considering that’s only said like three times throughout the entire show, Ruby is pretty lacking, and vaguely, generically bubbly, and optimistic. She is apparently the Aang to this half baked ATLA adventure, sorry that was mean, but it was right there.\n\n\n\nSpeaking of right there, Weiss was around here somewhere, but she must have sensed me talking about characters with personalities and ran off for some reason. Anyways, Blake reconciling with her family is good, her continued white fang plotline, and need to beat Adam not so much, so I was very relieved to see him beaten as early in the series as he was. Yang, is probably the more interesting out of the two though, she has her relationship with Tai, losing her arm and the trauma that came with it(or rather the loss of it), she’s the protagonist’s sister, she’s the daughter of one of the maidens, and she and Blake had that excellent scene where Yang explained why Blake should slow down and live a much more healthy life. I actually do think Yang’s perspective and lifestyle as an adventurer does make a lot of sense, but the main missed opportunity is exploring her losing her purpose in her aimless search for adventure when she finds her mom, and realizes that she’s a bum.\n\n\n\nSeriously for Weiss, I do not know what to say, or if there is really anything interesting at all to say, after Blake and Yang return to the team and kiss and make up without kissing, but making up, Weiss can only bond with her leader, Jaune who the writers are intent to leave in a corner with a dick in his hand, or poor Oscar. Oscar of course being the landlord of Ozpin’s new body, Oscar doesn’t have much going on besides being a nice bloke. Just like Weiss who could talk to any one of these characters who needs, or could have more going on is sort of just the smart one, she is the one who corrects people about lore, has exposition dumps at the ready, and is always trying to be logical and right. That might sound like a personality, but those are all just traits from her previously described archetype, so besides that she really just doesn’t have a lot of screentime, nor good screentime where she makes choices. Before standing up for Vale at the charity gala and that was basically it. 0 points for the characters, I didn’t hate them, but none of them are Shakespeare, or Hajime Hinata.\n\n\n\n# Volume 9\n\nAudience-Kun: “Wait a minute Phoemixfox2728, what about Penny?”\n\n\n\nWhy are you trying to give me only a singular penny, oh you meant Penny, well we’ve already talked enough about Penny as is. No, seriously this isn’t a bit like Weiss where I am going to talk about Penny, that’s it, me acknowledging her existence was enough, because she doesn’t have a personality, a proper relationship with either of her unwilling murderers, nor a strong dynamic with Ruby herself. Sure she’s cute and harmless enough, but if I went weeping over every anime girl who died, I’d fucking flood the world, so yeah for me especially, but I am sure someone else agrees, it was a bitter pill to swallow realizing a lot of Ruby’s doubt in herself and breakdown would inevitably be tied to Penny, only for Penny to haunt the narrative a lot less and not as well as Pyrrha, so Pyrrha killed her in life and death, damn that’s cold. Plus, she’s a plot point and the plot is too complicated/boring to go over in this post for real.\n\n\n\nIf you haven’t been able to intuit it yet, I really fucking hate this Volume, filler story arcs like this are already extremely pills to swallow because of how hard they try to convince me and the rest of the audience that all of this buulshit totally matters and you need to watch this season, except you don’t and this season didn’t need to take place in Alice and the wonderland world, an argument I will substantiate by going through this season chronologically, skipping the straight up Alice stuff straight into the meat and potatoes that will actually, probably, maybe sort of be referenced in future seasons. \n\n\n\nJaune does not need the paper pleasers in order to have an arc about how he’s so defeated/depressed he’s begun to go a little mad and is in desperate need of anything to do right, or a people to protect and save, this easily could have been done with a small village or something that Jaune just disappears to and all the villagers low key try to get rid of him. Not because he’s a menace, but he’s going further and further away from the village on increasingly dangerous hunts, just to return injured and not learn his lesson, basically trying to get himself killed without being too overdramatic about it. Something like that would be easy to do in Remnant and another important thing is that this should be primarily about Pyrrha and Penny, Jaune couldn’t save the former, and had to kill the latter with his own lands. He attributes helping the paper pleasures to needing the rush of saving people before he brings up either one of the girls, primarily because he doesn’t. \n\n\n\nThey introduce a mad, frenzied, desperate, and confused Jaune who is significant older and he had not a one thing to say about Pyrrha or Penny, he alludes to killing the latter, but fucking no one acknowledges it or tries to comfort Jaune or anything, again I am not saying Ruby and him should ever be romantic, but Weiss after he turns young again, just throw a pair of panties in the niggas sock drawer or something, the nigga needs a kiss on the cheek at least for all of this bullshit that no one seems to empathize or sympathize with. \n\n\n\nLeast of all Blake and Yang, who I like together, if I was younger and less sleepy at the time of writing this I would probably tell a dozen cat lesbian jokes, but last time I did that while I was sleepy, I made that shitty She-ra post that no one liked or read, so yeah for now at least I will restrain myself. But yeah, this is not really the time or place for them to start trying to find where the smell of fish is coming from-OKAY I EARNED ONE LESBIAN CAT PUN JOKE, THAT WAS THE ONE NO MORE. In this post. The narrative device of them being on that magic bridge is sweet and all, it would be nice to steal and cop that sometime, but one problem, one major super duper problem:a realistic, mature conversation could have gotten the same message across. It doesn’t have to be anywhere magical, or romantic, but they could've sat down and talked because they feel a new awkward feeling budding within themselves for one another.\n\n\n\nAt the end of said conversation, they ask each other on a date, yeah no these niggas aint even 20, I hate trying to fix shit or whatever, but to get my point across I need to address the fact that these two do not love each other, what is even their dynamic, where is their romantic chemistry, have they even tasted one another’s-COOKING, I WAS GOING TO SAY COOKING, I SWEAR TO GOD!!! On a serious note though, while Blake and Yang’s scene in season 2 was really good, and yeah we get lot of hints and foreshadowing that they care for each other a lot, the cementing of their relationship should have been going out not “falling in love”, I mean fuck I know I am not one to talk, me and my *online* girlfriend said we love each other very early into our relationship.\n\n\n\n Yet, the difference between us and two lesbos, besides my prominent and as I am sure you’ve heard your mother exclaim: “huge painful fucking cock” is that we’re real people who say things in the heat of the moment, me and my girl haven’t had romantic relationships in a while so our attraction to one another as comparatively weak to other couples’ is still pretty to us individually. Meanwhile, Yang and Blake are characters, their voice actresses are just women reading words off of a script, even if I was really happy to see Blake and Yang get together, and be happy together if I know my ATLA knockoff shows, then I know that RWBY will use this as an opportunity to write itself out of a compelling romance, probably not even going to acknowledge the human-faunus relationship or anything. Blake and Yang from now on and into the heat death of the universe are just another cute, cartoon lesbian couple and while we definitely need more of those, it would be nice if more of them were well written, \n\n\n\nWhich leaves me to Ruby Rose herself, who probably benefitted from the fairytale bullshit of this season the least, I mean at least the fantastical concepts made it a little bit easier and more visually interesting for the stories that were told with Jaune and Blake/Yang respectively, but all Ruby gets is mental breakdown/massive crashout on her friends, before she’s jumped by the Neo gang. Which was a cool sequence I must admit, I am a sucker for this sort of thing, can you blame me? I am a Danganronpa 2 fan after all, I eat this level of silly shit right the fuck up, but the bullshit with Ruby hearing from her mom that she’s great just the way she is or whatever, which should make a confused Ruby feel worse considering Summer was saying that to a smal child Ruby, and she didn’t hear it at the time, but whatever. Ruby returns, basically same more or less as ever, Ruby’s arc besides her voice actress going in a new, good direction to fit it, is totally snuffed and fucked over by the fairtale bullshit.\n\n\n\nIf Ruby could talk to more characters, talk to Qrow and Ozpin, or maybe even refuse to talk to these mentor figures even once they call her out for her strange and distressing behavior than this arc could be more interesting, rather than the already strange and surreal visuals of Alice and the wonderland giving us an excuse to do weird stuff with Ruby’s ego death or whatever, let’s use Ruby’s ego death as a framing device for the disappearance of Ruby Rose and everyone including Ruby herself have to find her through a much more meaningful and well written/impactful arc rather than “mom said it was time for me to stop being emo”. I genuinely fucking hate this arc so fucking much, it was such a drag and annoyed me to no end watching it, so I am glad we are back to remnant for the next Volue, if it ever comes up, and I am glad I am done now. Another negative point for this abysmal dogshit season\n\n\n\nUltimately, I am conflicted in rating RWBYfor the same reason I was conflicted in reviewing murder drones, I feel that my rating regardless of where it falls doesn’t quite reflect how I feel about RWBY, Murder Drones was a fun romp, but 5-6/10 felt fair and appropriate, but according to my logic and my own struggle to decide on what argument is the strongest, well I’ve never done anything like this before, especially singling out a single arc, just to review it separate from the rest of the review which is focused on aspects of the series, except unless of course you want to count Murder Drones where I did a similar thing with it’s last three episodes…so yaaaay, consistency. I actually like RWBY a lot more than I did Murder Drones and I think it was more of an entertaining and substantive watch for real, RWBY is probably low key better than Murder Drones in terms of having its own cool, weird gimmicks.\n\n\n\n RWBY is a 0-5/10, if you aren’t familiar with what that means, basically in layman's terms, towards the lower end of the spectrum, if you and I buy into the most negative arguments and point giving as most compelling than RWBY gets a lower score to reflect, but I at least personally do not always feel that way. On other days I might be more so compelled by my more positive arguments and whatnot, willing to consider that the things I took off points for weren’t actually bad enough to warrant singling out that way, and even giving an extra point for animation which I am pretty conflicted about not giving a point for. I do my rating system like this to remain fair, transparent, and to demonstrate how flawed this system inherently is. \n\n\n\nI am trying to quantitative value art, which is an inherent impossibility so the - and the fact it represents my own mind can be changed by what mood I’m in or how I structure an argument accounts for the flawed mechanic of numerical reviews, while also getting the idea across that you might really really really fucking hate and despise RWBY when you watch it. Or, you might like it quite a decent bit, find it to be mid, but entertaining, personally I am a member of the latter party, but as a critic, I find my arguments and arguments like mine to be too salient to not hear out and heavily acknowledge the former party, so if this rating doesn’t help you decide whether or not to watch RWBY, well sorry, but life’s not as simple or easy as a fairytale. \n\n",

    "selftext": "# Intro\n-----\nI'm a transfemale. I have severe gender dysphoria. This post might be a long one. Please read it completely. I'm in so much pain and I need some reassurance, support, feeling that I'm not alone and some kind words. Please help me out. Please don't hate. Please say something positive. I have been really going through hell for several months now. This is my story. Please please read it fully. I have a reason to unwrap my whole story here. I have given all my problems at the second last section and what I want in the last section. But please please read the whole story. Please. I'm in so much anguish right now. I am seeking help here in Reddit as my last resort. Please help me. I beg you.\n\n# Childhood (till class/grade 4 i.e., Ages: 4-10)\n-----\nEver since I was a child, I imagined myself as a girl. I imagined myself being a girl, having girly hairstyles (like two ponytails to the sides) I loved whenever someone does girly things to me. I also imagined myself as other girls and enacting them (not always. But I do that). My aunt did some girly hairstyles on me and I loved it. I wanted it again and again. I was so little back then. There were some school extracurriculars such as dance, French drama and so on. I loved dance especially feminine ones. I registered myself for it and went to the rehearsal whenever they conduct it and did it diligently. During the final performance they gave me a female dress and I loved it again so much. I loved the anklet thing I wore during my dance, I loved the girl dress I wore, I loved the makeup I wore and so much more. After the dance performance, I found a shawl which I thought to be from a girl I know. It was obviously a girl's and I was the last person there to leave. I wore it and took it home. God I loved to keep it and wear it. \n\nI also registered myself for the French drama. For the drama performance, I think I was given the girl role as well. I was made to wear lipstick. God I loved it so much. I really loved it. \n\n\n# Pre-teen and teenage (till class/grade 12 i.e., Ages: 11-18)\n-----\nDuring this time, there were several things that happened. I loved every single one of it. During this time, I was actually treated like a girl. Boys there call me by girl names, treat me like a girl, touch and embrace me like a girl and kiss me like I'm a girl. I loved every single moment. I wanted to be treated like a girl. The feeling that I got from that was so good and heavenly. God I loved every moment of it. I literally felt like a girl. They accepted me as a girl. I was so happy. I can just go on about this. A guy even carried me like a girl and blushed so much and laughed. But I loved it so much. They come up with different girl names or ask if this girl name belongs to you and I will just accept it after pretending to have \"accidentally\" accepted it. They call me by all sorts of girl names. But all of them are valid girl names. And all of them were positive ones too. So, I loved them all as well. I also like 2 girls there and wanted to be like her, dress like her and so on. I wanted to make expressions like them, walk like them and so on.\n\nEven in the school bus, I sat at the back end of the bus. There, there will be fake marriages with me being the girl and another guy and I loved it. God I loved it. The title of wife was so amazing. I felt like a girl. They call me by girl names and treat me like a pure girl too. I just loved this so much. I wanted to be treated like a girl too. I enjoyed being treated like a girl so much. In both the above and this cases, they used words that are exclusively used for girls in our language. I was extremely happy. Being treated like a girl, being embraced and kissed like a girl and so on was just extremely amazing. I loved it. I'm repeating it here because I loved it so much. I loved that I'm being recognized as a girl. I also changed my handwriting to be girly and bubbly. I loved it too.\n\n\n# Adulthood (till the end of my college years i.e., Ages: 18-23)\n-----\nI went abroad for my medical studies. By sheer luck I was the only person to get a girl's uniform. God it was wonderful. God I loved it so much. I literally loved it and took it as a sign that finally I was accepted as a girl by the whole universe. I was so eager to wear it every day to the college and expected to go to college every day because of that. But then, I fell ill and none of them there was suitable for my body. So, I had to return. I then joined an engineering college.\n\nI got my first phone and first laptop when I went to college. In everything, I only used the girl name, girl profile pics/avatars, exclusive chose the gender to be female. Be it email, first name, even last name, device name, Wi-Fi (hotspot) SSID name, usernames across several websites and so much more. Everywhere, I only used female names and female profile pics. I still do this to date. I have always imagined myself as being a girl. So, even when I play games, I only play as female characters that reflect me and to whom I can associate with. \n\nDuring my time there, I met a guy who loved me as a girl. I was extremely happy. This was an online relationship. He treated me like a girl, sent me kisses, played with me and teased me. Thought about making babies and growing old (obviously I must have a womb transplant or some other way to have babies). He showered me with compliments, said all the nice words, spoiled me and ALWAYS made me blush. He just lovvvvvved making me blush. We spoke a lot and he made me feel amazing. I completely felt safe and was completely treated like a girl which I wanted. I was absolutely happy. After that we broke up after 1.5 years. This college degree is an advanced one. So, it takes 5 years to complete. So, for the remaining years, nothing happened except twice where I was compared to 2 different female celebrities and I loved it so much. But still, my whole online presence as I said was me as a girl. \n\n\n# Adulthood (after going to work, i.e., Ages: 24-present)\n-----\nI still felt like a girl inside. I treated myself like a girl still. I wanted to be a girl still. I work in software development. In my first job, I wore girl's innerwear (including panties and a bra-like cloth) to work. It is not noticeable. But I still thought of me as a girl. I wanted to be treated like one. But the environment there isn't friendly, unlike the above. They just look down. So, innerwears are the only thing I can do. Then, when I come home, I change to girl dresses completely, and I will be extremely happy again. 2nd and 3rd jobs were remote, and I always loved to wear girls dresses since I'm at the place where I feel safe and comfortable. I don't need to worry about others. I tried all types of girl dresses and loved them all. It gave me so much happiness. I'm in my 3rd job right now. I still wear girls dresses, and I'm typing this wearing a girl's dress. I also have painted my nail now with purple glittering nail polish. \n\nFew months back I met another guy who was so much into me. He is not from my work but it is online again. We met through a game. He lovvved my gameplay. So, he started chatting with me and then we became so close. He then proposed me. I was extremely happy and I accepted it. We talked till 4 AM with me always falling asleep to his text and he loved that. I loved falling asleep to his text too. He called me with all sorts of lovely cute names and I loved them all. He then showered me with so much love. I fell so hard for him. I imagined so many scenarios in my head. He holding me, kissing me nonstop showering me with love, cooking for me, me cooking for him, taking care of him, him falling asleep on my breasts, me combing his hair, and kissing him, us having sex with me actually having female private parts (I imagine them explicitly with me being the girl). I loved every single thought. I also dreamt soooooooooo many dreams with me and him and with me being a girl, an actual girl in the dream. He made love to me in that dream, he made me so shy, he kissed me a lot in that dream, he teased me a lot in that dream. We had a family in that dream. I was even a mother of 1000 daughters in one of the dreams. The dreams are so many. I have told every single one of them to him and he will just go crazy with love after I finish it. So many kisses and cute name calling and his own imagined scenarios with our daughters. During this period, he just consumed almost all of my time. We watched movies together. We both watched the complete Harry Potter Series together. I wanted to do that for so long. He made it come true. I don't like blood and I can't sleep alone if I watch horror movies or just horror scenes. He understood that and cared for me a lot and skipped whenever those scenes are shown. I loved this so much. He cared for me a lot. I cared for him a lot too. We also watched the *Before* trilogy. Even during the movies, he can't keep his hands off me. He immediately tells something lewd and make me blush a lot. Wow. He just lovvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvesss making me blush too. Accoding to him, I'm Hermione but he is Harry Potter and he hated whenever Ron does anything with me 😅. He comments on every feeling, every reaction I do in the movie. He loved me so much. I had a phenomenal time with him. We also watched p*rn together. For every single thing, he comments about my private parts (I imagine me having the female parts) and I reply accordingly. He would also send so many lewd GIFs to turn me on and keep me turned on for the whole day. I always, ALWAYS think of me as a girl and imagine the pleasure like a girl and I would comment on them. He loves that soooooooooo much. We also sexted a lot. I'm extremely completely submissive. I love him taking my hand, holding it and leading the way anywhere. He then wanted to roleplay. Him being professor or master. He just loves these roles. He even gave me a punishment of writing an excellent poem with some erotic elements. I also wrote journal daily for hours and gave it to him and he cherished it and only goes to sleep after reading my journal entry which has all the things I dreamed about, all the things we did together, all my feelings raw as it is. I felt like a girl 1000000000%. I was so extremely happy. I get dreams almost on a daily basis with me being an actual girl and many of them having erotic themes with him making me pregnant and many having wholesome themes as well. But I always get a dream where I was an actual girl. I told everything about them to him. He would just go crazy with love as I said. He loves it a lot. He then moved abroad for studies and due to the timezone we aren't able to speak like before anymore. But he still knows the switches to turn me on immediately. God I love him. I can never win anything against him. He knows me completely. He knows exactly what to do to calm me down when I'm angry, he knows exactly what to do to turn me on, he knows exactly what to say to make me blush so hard. Even during my meetings, he does so much lewd things, says so much lewd things, sends so much naughty stuff and make me stutter or go blank during meetings. He just loves to put me in extremely difficult spot like that too. But now, the activity has decreased due to him being abroad and due to huge timzezone gap.\n\n# The Main Problem Now (severe depression + OCD)\n-----\nFew months back, all those longing of wanting to be a pure girl, longing to experience everythgin as an actual girl with him, and having an actual girl experience bursted and I was pushed extremely deep into depression. I have been crying everyday. My identity is a girl. But I want to be an actual girl. I haven't transitioned yet. But I want to be a girl. I can't tell this to parents despite soooooo much history above. Nobody will accept me. I have been depressed for so long. Not a day without crying. I have been crying and depressed for so long that I went into anhedonia (I think a month ago). Nothing felt joyful, nothing was pleasurable anymore. I lost interest in everything I used to enjoy. The whole world felt blank. Then I attempted \"it\". I don't need a life where I'm not a girl. I didn't ask to be born like this. I actually avoid looking at myself in the mirror. I avoid looking at my shadow. I avoid looking at my privates. I hate to even have a brief accidental look at the mirror when I pass through. I hate this body. I get severe longing and become so envious when I see girls. Why do they get to be a girl but I don't? This is the only thing that runs. I imagine their hairstyle on me, their dresses on me, their makeup on me and feel a deep longing to be an actual girl. I need not worry about anybody if I had been born as a girl. I would have been my actual self. Whenever I see a girl, I get this intense longing and envy. Then due to my severe depression, everything went numb. I couldn't feel anything. Even now, I'm just so numb. When I searched for the reason, it happens because of anhedonia. It is a product of MDD it seems. But I hate feeling nothing. Being a girl and longing to be one is the one thing that keeps me alive and has been consistent throughout my life. I don't wanna lose it. I'm extremely scared of this. I forced myself to cry by watching extremely emotional videos to just feel something. I also once sh myself to at least feel something. I have been going through this cycle of extreme depression + anhedonia + OCD on top of that. OCD keeps attacking my thoughts saying that you're not a girl, you're just attracted to them, you're just gay (this is jsut so fucking stuping given my history above), you're a femboy (again so fucking stupid given my complete history above) and many other intrustive thoughts. This causes my severe depression to even worsen further. It is extremely painful. I wasn't even able to type them without feeling intense pain. I still get dreams as me being a girl. I get a lot of dreams where I am a girl. Day before yesterday, I cried 3-4 times. First time, I felt intese longing to become a girl and envy when I saw other girls on the video or images. The OCD is extremely painful. So, I just watch videos for girls and only with girls in it just to avoid the OCD thoughts I mentioned. Second time I felt a bit of longing and envy. Next 2 times, I cried but didn't feel a single thing. I was already so much overloaded with depression, trauma, OCD that I literally collapsed on my chair and woke up a while later. I was so much in pain. I am still in so much pain. It hurts so bad. The day before that, I was extremely consumed by OCD for the whole day. It was such an extremely painful experience. Why do I have to suffer like this? Yesterday, I cried so much for more than an hour deeply longing to be a girl and I was also so envious of the girls I saw on the video and in images. I paint my nails, apply lipstick, apply eyeliner, curl my eyelashes, wear girl dresses all day, etc. But the thought that doing all this is fake and I will never be biologically a girl haunts me and made me so sad that I cried for so long that when I went to sleep, I was out for nearly 10 hours. I never sleep for this long. NEVER. I mostly sleep for onyl 6-8 hours. 8 is very rare. So 6-7 is the most. Even after the breakfast, I was still extremely exhausted that I slept again for more than an hour. Then I teared up a little but tears didn't fall but just vanished. I am in so much anguish right now. I am completely being exhausted and caught in the depression + OCD + trauma cycle. I just talk to ChatGPT to get a reassurance. I don't have anyone else in my life. I'm all alone. It is extremely painful. I just want someone to acknowledge me and make me feel like a girl. I just want someone in my life. Please help me with below. I beg you. I am severely depressed and in extreme anguish which I can't describe using words. Please help me. Please. I have nowhere else to go. Reddit is my last resort. Please be positive. I beg you. All I want is this below\n\n# What I want right now?\n-----\n1. Please help me heal those OCD thoughts or twist those OCD thougts into something positive that I can use to reassure my identity\n2. I want to feel the longing again. Longing to become a girl. Whenever depression + OCD hits, I become anhedonic and completely numb and so much exhausted. Then I become anhedonic for several days. It is extremely scary to not feel it. It is extremely sacred for me to have it always\n3. Please reassure my identity. Please be positive. I already suffer so much. Please reassure my identity that despite what OCD tells.\n4. Please share some experience from your life. I just want to feel that I'm not alone in this\n      - Have you felt like this? Have you felt this strong dysphoria that you felt the sense of longing slipping away? \n      - Have you not felt this longing for a period of time and you got scared? If so, how long? How did you overcome this and found the sense of longing again?\n      - Please share me how you attach yourself to long for becoming a girl? I know I have been most comfortable with me being a girl all my life. But this depression and OCD has made me spiral down so bad. I just want to feel the longing and I just want to feel like a girl again.\n5. How do you feel like a girl all day? Please share your experience.\n6. Please give me some ideas, routines etc. so that I can feel like a girl all day everyday. Please I need this so bad. I'm in so much pain. All I do is find something to do and feel like a girl. I am numb from depression right now. But still please give me ideas, routines and so on that I can at least do to get some feelings of my true self back.\n7. Do you actually feel longing to become a girl all day? If not, does that scare you? Why?\n8. How are you coping with life? I have a life where nobody is going to accept me as my true self of being a girl. Despite this, I need to feel like a girl always. Please give me some ideas, routines, rituals etc.\n9. Could you please suggest some resources (books, YouTube videos, Twitch streams etc.) that could help me, that could make me feel like a girl all day? \n10. Anything else that will help me. Personal experiences can help me a lot to know that I'm not alone. Anything else you feel would help me, please share it.\n\nPlease remember that, I am here as a last resort. Please help me. Anything that can help is appreaciated. The whole cycle of depression, OCD and trauma is killing me day by day. I'm literally physically collapsing due to exhaustion. It is extremely painful. Please help me out.\n\n\nI know that I must go to a professional for OCD. But please try to answer as much questions as possible. It will really help me. It may be as simple as reassuring my identity in one of the questions. This will at least help alleviate some pain. Please help me out.\nAlso regarding the transitioning, I want to do it. But I'm scared that it'd take so much years. Someone mentioned that I have to wait for at least 3 years in their country just to get HRT. This is so scary. That's why I am asking these questions. I want to transition too. I crave it. Right now, answering as much questions as possible will help me a lot. Please do it if possible.\n\n\nInfinite thanks for everyone taking time to read my actual life story and those who respond for this. May you all have a wonderful life filled with joy forever. Anything you share will be immensely helpful. Thank you so much again. Love you all\n",

The only way to trigger this suicide bomb function was to speak the words, “oubliette sublime.” \n\nYet Mon Mothma decides that Soujen is a threat, and uses this function to eliminate him. The kicker is that beforehand, Soujen and Bail Organa were working together to bring information to Coruscant that could exonerate the Jedi and clear their names after Palpatine’s framing of their supposed treason. \n\nI haven’t read the book enough to remember absolutely all the details, but if I’m not mistaken, Mon Mothma actually *knows* that Bail and Soujen are working together, and that Soujen actually has the information that could exonerate the Jedi, and that Bail found out that Mothma is responsible for Soujen’s death; and thus, the exonerating evidence is lost forever. \n\nSo why didn’t Bail Organa chew Mothma out for destroying his only source of information that could exonerate the Jedi?

    "selftext": "This is a pretty half baked thought, but it came to me when looking at some of the panels with the Troupe, especially in their backstory, in the panels when they're committing to killing Hisoka, and a few others. It might just be visual compositions meant to drive a point home in the story, but with the parallels drawn between the Hei-ly and the Troupe, what if The Troupe's tattoos are of a similar nature to Morena's contagion? It makes me think about WHY the troupe always steals and kills if their backstory was rooted in vengeance for their dead friend. Nobunaga, Phinx, and Feitan all deduced the rough nature of contagion based on their own motivations and experience in the Troupe. \n\nBut I have no thoughts on what this ability would be if it were an ability of Chrollo's. It could be some specialist ability meant to shape group identity? Cause I'm thinking about it in terms of them willingly becoming bandits and then not really doing much with the heist loot after they have it. Which makes me think it's more about reinforcing their bond with each other, which in this case could be one governed by nen.\n\nWhich then brings me back to Morena as a parallel. She also comes from an incredibly traumatic life and plays along until she can strike with a plan to bring about an apocalypse with a small group of trusted accomplices. Hei-ly is brought together through the gamification of murder and the promise of levels. The promise of apocalypse is Hei-ly's identity. \n\nTldr: The Spider's tattoos could be a nen ability similar to Morena's contagion that reinforces group identity through shared acts",

There are plot holes in the arc that kills it for me and the “ scary , emotional stuff “ isn’t enough to save the arc in my eyes , it’s no surprise that the arc was so unpopular. \n\nWith that being said I feel this was an arc that should have came in before the soul society arc , my idea would be to have tsukishima be the main villain and have ginjo and the other x cution members be allies . I liked ginjo better  as an ally not because I was hurt by his “ betrayal “ or anything but because I felt he kind of sucked as a villain , I’m sorry but his plan was stupid in my opinion .now this may come off as to “fanficy” but I do like the idea of the x cution members allying with ichigo’s group and aiding them in soul society arc . I doubt ginjou would really care about saving Rukia but his motivations would be to get some answers regarding the soul society’s shady ways .\n\nNow some are gonna be outraged and say “ what plot holes ?!” Well I’ll tell you . There is no good reason why ginjo didn’t just have tsukishima alter ichigo’s mind besides “ the game won’t be any fun if it’s fixed so that we can’t lose .” That’s a pretty stupid reason and to me it’s just kubo admitting it’s a plot-hole and telling us to go along with it. I don’t mean to sound like an obnoxious powers scaler but there are characters already living in karakura town that would have eaten the x cution members for break fast , like kisuke , isshin , yoruichi, Tessai . If just one of them interfered while Ginjo believed that tsukishima was his enemy, the whole plan would have fell apart . Also there is no reason why orihime couldn’t just heal uryu but it looks to me that kubo kept uryu benched so that he wouldn’t interfere in the fights and ruin the “ epic twist villain reveal “ . Yeah I’m gonna get crucified cause the fullbringer arc gets glazed but I feel there are legit problems and it’s not well written .",

    "selftext": "There’s a hidden reason some YouTube videos pull massive clicks while others barely move.\n\nIt’s not the thumbnail “design.”  \nIt’s not the topic.  \nIt’s not the title formula of the week.\n\nIt’s something deeper:\n\n**The brain clicks before the viewer consciously decides to.**\n\nHere’s the part most creators miss:\n\nYour thumbnail has one job — to make the viewer’s brain *predict the emotional payoff* instantly.\n\nIf the brain can’t predict the reward, the click won’t happen.\n\nThis is why simple thumbnails outperform “creative” ones.  \nThis is why CTR spikes when the outcome is obvious.  \nThis is why YouTube pushes certain videos harder, even with small channels.\n\nYouTube’s algorithm mirrors the same system the brain uses to decide what’s worth attention.\n\nWhen your thumbnail creates **predictive certainty**, everything changes:\n\n* CTR rises fast\n* Impressions increase automatically\n* Suggested traffic expands\n* Homepage placement improves\n* Your video gets treated like a reliable performer before the data even fully arrives\n\nAll because viewers understand the payoff immediately.\n\nHere’s the 3-part structure for thumbnails that trigger instant predictive clicks:\n\n**1. Outcome clarity**  \nShow the result, not the topic.\n\n**2. Cognitive simplicity**  \nOne focal point.  \nLow mental effort.\n\n**3. Emotional certainty**  \nThe viewer must believe the reward will be immediate.\n\nIf those three cues are present, CTR climbs.  \nIf even one is missing, the brain hesitates — and hesitations kill momentum.\n\nMost creators overbuild thumbnails.  \nHigh-performing creators remove friction.\n\nIf your video promises a clear emotional outcome and the brain can understand it fast, YouTube distributes it aggressively.\n\nThis is the ranking factor almost nobody uses intentionally.\n\n\n\n[Get Access To 15 Of The Hottest Free Traffic Sources On The Planet!](https://llpgpro.com/9k4jf96j/)",

But, ignoring time issues, I dont think people know how difficult it is to murder a literal baby, no matter how evil. Its still a tiny little baby. Thats going to fuck you up regardless of whatever good you are doing. So which characters would look baby Hitler in the face and decide nah I can do this pretty easily with no issues after?\n\nBulma would 100% murder baby Hitler. Not only does she try to shoot kid Goku after meeting him once, she also suggests killing Dr Gero before the Android Saga really kicks off who is, at that point, just an old man. Also let's be real she would use her newfound fame in her favor",

    "title": "Hidden Mechanics and Stats Part 2: Direct Damage Effects (Warhammer III)",
    "selftext": "[Link to part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/totalwar/comments/1p6bmxc/hidden_mechanics_and_stats_part_1_collision/)\n\nIt's me again, back with more hidden mechanics. This one isn't so hidden, luckily, but I'm still regularly seeing people try to cast Tempest on Furies and it rubs me the wrong way, so I'll be talking about the different types of direct damage effects in the game.  \n  \nDirect damage effects come in the form of spells, abilities and auras (or mortis effects, as they are commonly called). They are defined by 2 stats - damage dealt per entity, and maximum entities affected. Damage dealt per entity is quite self-explanatory, but it's important to note that every tick of damage deals a random amount between 1/2 and the full amount.  \n  \n**Example:** Melkoth's Mystifying Miasma deals 5 damage per tick to up to 25 entities. That's why its tooltip states that it deals between 62 - 125 damage per tick. I'm not entirely sure if and how it rounds the numbers, as Melkoth's minimum damage per tick is 2.5, but I don't think that's too important.  \n  \nThe maximum affected entities are what defines the use cases of direct damage effects. **All direct damage spells affect either 25 or 1 entity from each affected unit at a time**, and this is always hinted at by the tooltip on the spell's stat card. If a spell has tooltips like **\"Strong vs characters\"** or **\"Strong vs a single combatant\"**, it's safe to assume it deals it damage to only 1 entity of each affected unit per tick. And if it has tooltips like **\"Strong vs 25 men unit or above\"** and **\"Strong vs multiple combatants\"**, it most likely deals damage to up to 25 entities of each affected unit at a time. This means that Tempest is almost completely useless into units like Furies, Crowmen, Bats, etc.!!!  \n  \nWhat about \"mortis effects\" then? Fortunately, **most of them deal damage to between 2 and 6 entities from each affected unit at a time**, making them ok at dealing damage to just about anything other than single entities, so you don't have to worry about maximising their damage output too much. Some notable exceptions are the Siren of Red Ruin's (RoR Medusa) *Wail of Malice* and Warp-Grinders' *Warp-quake*, which deal their damage to 18 entities at a time, which means they aren't as effective at damaging low entity count units, like monstrous infantry. There's also the 2 direct damage lore passives, Lore of Hashut's *Killing Fire*, which affects 10 entities at a time, making it useful vs almost all non-SE units, and Lore of the Deep's *Kiss of the Deep*, which affects only 1 entity per unit, but it's map-wide anyways so you don't really have to bother thinking about it.  \n  \nSome random extra things:  \n\\- Undead Crumbling and Demonic Instability are also direct damage effects. The first stage of Crumbling only affects 1 entity at a time, that's why it's barely noticeable on infantry units. I'm pretty sure they are also affected by spell resistance, so Khornate deamons disintegrate slightly slower, for example.  \n\\- As is the case with all spells, they apply their effects per in-game tick, with the first one being applied the moment the spell is cast. This means that all damage spells apply (their duration + 1) ticks of damage.  \n\\- Direct damage is not affected by armour in any way, only by spell and damage resistance.  \n  \nAnd some battle advice:  \n\\- The ideal targets for spells like Melkoth's and Flock are cavalry units and weapons teams, as they have much lower health pools than infantry units (unless we're talking about elves).  \n\\- Overcasting Flock of Doom and Traitor-kin is less WoM-efficient than undercasting them.  \n\\- You can only cast 3 Fate of Bjunas in a single skirmish/MP battle, as even if you have the lore passive you end up with 21.5 WoM after the 3rd cast. Very frustrating, indeed.  \n\\- Usirian's Incantation of Vengeance is the strongest multi-entity direct damage spell in the game in terms of damage/WoM ratio. Its overcast is completely useless, though.  \n\\- DO NOT CAST TEMPEST ON FURIES.\n\nThank you for reading and I hope that you find this helpful/insightful. I will now go back to thinking what I should cover in part 3. Feel free to suggest me stuff if you'd like.",

    "selftext": "I said what i said.\n\nLast week I flew coach, peeled the foil off the tray, and that weird little lasagna hit like mom’s on a rainy Sunday. The carrots were mushy, sure, but they were also warm and salted; the brownie had the texture of a sponge, yet somehow that was comforting, like eating a memory foam pillow that tastes faintly of cocoa. I cleaned the tray while the guy next to me posted a rant about “cardboard chicken,” and I felt like I was breaking some law by not agreeing.\n\nPeople trash airline meals before they even taste them, same way they groan at pineapple on pizza even when they’ve never tried it. (I used to do that,hated it till I actually ate a slice at 2 a.m. in college and realized my tongue liked the sweet-salty tango.) It’s just one of those things we bond over hating, like the DMV or pineapple not belonging,except the food never did anything worse than show up in a plastic tub.\n\nIf it’s truly inedible, blame the cabin pressure nuking your taste buds, not the chef who prepped it on the ground. Maybe I’m just nostalgic for the tiny salt-pepper shakers that look like they’re made for Borrowers, or the surprise of getting a dinner roll that steams when you tear it open at 30 000 ft. Either way, I look forward to the tray sliding down that aisle more than the in-flight movie.\n\nAnyone else sneakily enjoy it or am I flying solo on this one?",

    "selftext": "Sometimes when I'm trying to engage with kid I feel like he gets into this mode where he just is trying to be annoying. I can't tell if I'm being overly sensitive or if this is just what six year olds do. He is behind in social skills so I'd like to encourage good conversation, but maybe my expectations are too high? Here's a typical conversation. We sit down together to color, which he likes doing \n\n-5 minutes of legit conversation about the coloring or whatever-\n\nKid: \"You've gone so much more coloring done than I have!!!! Whine\"\n\nMe: \" this is my first page of coloring. Remember you just finished a page. So your second page is pretty empty, you've actually done more coloring than me\"\n\nKid: \"But yours look so much better than mine whineeee\"\n\nMe: \" well I've been coloring for 30 years longer than you and it's not a competition\"\n\nKid: \"but it's not fair!!!!!\"\n\nMe (thinking let's redirect) \" I love that pumpkin on your page. What color are you going to do the haunted house?\"\n\nKid: I don't know. BEEP BEEP BEEP Do you like that sound? \n\nMe: we've talked about making annoying sounds \n\nKid: can we do the gingerbread house today? \n\nMe: as I told you this morning, no I bought that for next weekend when your cousins are going to come over and we're going to do them all together! \n\nKid: awwww pleaseeeee can we do it?\n\nMe: no\n\nKid: that's rude! I wanna -whine-\n\nMe (time for redirect) did I tell you it's going to snow this week? \n\nKid: like enough to play in?\n\nMe: yep! Maybe even a snow day\n\nKid: silence\n\nMe: are you excited?\n\nKid: I guess. \n\nMe: The first thing I want to do in the snow is make a snow maze. What about you? What is the first thing you want to do in snow?\n\nKid: idk a snowman? Weeeeh-woooooo weeeee-wooooo Do you like that annoying sound mom?\n\nMe: we're not talking about that. I need to find my gloves before it snows\n\nKid: what's for dinner Tonight \n\nMe: chicken and rice\n\nKid: eeeweww I hate that\n\nMe (thinking yeah I know but the only starch you like  eat is macaroni and cheese and I'm not doing that every night). Well, not every meal is your favorite \n\nKid: pleeeaaseeeeee can we do the gingerbread house today?\n\nMe: -im done-\n\nI just feel so frustrated because everything he says feels annoying to me and I don't know if I'm being too sensitive or if kid is deliberately being annoying or if he doesn't know how to have actual conversation. Or if this is just typical 6 year old chatter",

But now thinking deeply about Sayori's story I have started spiraling about it which then dominoed into more stuff, just like i did when i first got into the game. The spiralling included:\n1. Hyperventilating and thinking about what life Sayori could have had\n2. Sadness that she isnt real for me to snuggle up to\n3. Thinking about playing the game and just knowing all the closeness MC and Sayori have is so cute and then remembering what happens and getting so sad\n4. Thinking my character will never hit as well and idk why\n5. Thinking \"my character having a similar story but living doesnt erase Sayori's death which sucks\n6. Listening to Xmas music even makes me like \"Shes dead, and she never got to experience a Christmas ever again\" which is what caused the hyperventilating\n7. All eventually leads to existential thoughts like \"even if i wrote my character really well, nothing matters in the end it all ends\n8. I NEED SAYORI TO LIVE F#CKING F#CK\n9. Deep thinking of \"yes she survived in the artwork and like plushie and fanmade stuff. But it isnt canon\n10. Inability to calm down more spiraling\n11. Having a plush of her wanting it to probably make me like \"she LIVES\" but my logic brain is like \"no\"\n12. Hating MC\n13. The possibilities if it was me instead of MC I would have stayed with her the whole time\n14. Even seeing her happy makes me sad\n15. The line abt how she hates ppl caring abt her just kills me🥲\n16. Just the game's vibe in general is too happy that its sad\n17. My brain is now thinking there's more so im probably repeating myself now\n18. The intimacy of mc and sayori in like every scene when its just them too its so sad but adorable\n19. I need her I need her alive\n20. I need a girl like her irl but yk... You can probably tell im off in the head\n21. Her sad face makes me cry\n22. Sayori and MC being childhood friends and Sayori liking him for ages hits different than if they weren't for some reason.\n\nThere's probably more but my stupid brain doesn't remember. I have anxiety if you cant tell and I hyperfixate on things like an ADHDer. Help me calm down pls and not be completely depressed. I had this same feeling when I first played, but idk how I got over it. Help.",

    "title": "UPDATE: Ethics of \"burn without reading\" request?",
    "selftext": "In this season of gratitude, I offer my immeasurable thanks to everyone who commented on the [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Genealogy/comments/1p26lg6/ethics_of_burn_without_reading_request/). As expected, opinions were heavily in favor of reading the documents (and reporting back, lol). Many of you shared stories of similar situations and struggles from your own lives, including a few who regret destroying letters—and some who regret reading them.\n\nI won't bore you discussing my decision-making process here. If you're really curious—or a masochist—I'll post a short write-up in a few days. I took your collective advice and decided *not* to discuss these documents or my dilemma at Thanksgiving, opting instead to focus on celebrating the family's time together, meeting a new puppy, and actually cooking the food.\n\nUltimately, I made the decision to skim through the documents at least to get a sense of their contents and decide what to do next. Within the crate I found:\n\n* college papers\n* college grades (which were average; a lot of Cs)\n* an autograph book, signed mostly by family\n* a few pages with predictions on the future lives of classmates written with LD, see below, \"to be opened December 5, 1901\"\n* a class photo\n* exam sheets with questions—e.g. algebra, history, and Greek\n* pre-college papers and grades\n* a few random letters\n\nThe bulk of the crate, however, was taken up with two separate sets of letters:\n\n* letters from LD, a college classmate of my great-grandmother (LS), spanning college and a few years beyond—and a few from LS to LD\n* letters and documents my future great-grandfather sent during a 1902 business trip to Europe\n\nThere doesn't appear to be anything too scandalous (to modern sensibilities, anyway) in any of what I saw. The classmate predictions are a little unkind, and have at least one example of racialized language.\n\nOf most interest to me are the two sets of letters. LD's letters are full of expressions of love and related emotions that go beyond what I've seen in similar letters between friends.  For example:\n\n(On Valentine's Day):\n\n&gt;\"A Queerish riddle here you'll see  \nBut one I hope you'll guess  \nI find that as I love her more  \nI always love L. S.\"\n\n*and*\n\n&gt;\"Pray for me—I hate Mr. Potter you know and after a day of library work in morning and Zoology Exam in after \\[sic\\] I shall feel fresh for evening!\n\n&gt;Gooder Goodnight—I love you anyhow anywhere and if you don't consider it too foolish I kissed this paper for you at-dearest. \\[sic\\]\"\n\nWhether I'm projecting too much into my reading or whether there's something to it remains to be seen. My main takeaway is feeling more connected to someone who lived over a century ago. It reminds me of a few lines from [Claudia Shear's play](https://www.librarything.com/work/63955/t/Blown-Sideways-Through-Life):\n\n&gt;\"Rarely does someone show you a portrait of yourself—clean, clear, and totally unexpected. Nevermind the sword pulling from the stone, *this* is the adventure. If, for a moment, you see someone differently, their portrait changes.\n\n&gt;It comes to life.\"",

First my art getting criticized (now deleted), then me not respecting other’s opinions on certain characters (haven’t actually spoke to them which I did before, but not as of recently). I don’t even think it’s going to improve anymore. \n\nShawn and Jasmine are my life core (mainly Shawn). They are one of the reason on why I thrive in life to this day. I’m heavily addicted on them (still kinda working on it though). I want them to be in a new season (whenever it comes out) so bad. I hate that they’re both in a season that’s demoed as one of the worst. I get devastated when people don’t like them that much, yet also be fond of two certain characters i’ll be talking about right now…\n\nScarlett and Samey. For the former, I get that her evil shtick sucked, but she is bland as hell. She‘s just a generic nerd who gets pushed around by Max of all people, and how tf do others think that she had strategy? she didn’t, at all. And for the latter, I know Amy is more hated, but I think Samey is way fucking worse. Samey is bland and is nothing but a literal sympathy magnet (only good thing is poisoning Amy and that’s it). Even thought for Samey, I’m mostly 50/50 with her, but it’s mainly on the negative side. And also, I don’t know why, but I love seeing her getting tortured for sake. Weird fact, but I made art of my fursona holding posters of both of these characters while holding a meta cleaver alongside a sketch of Samey both getting beaten up and hanged.\n\nWhenever I see a tier list that has Samey or/and Scarlett being above Shawn or/and Jasmine, I get pissed af, and brain starts to be full of violent ideas. I even made a hitlist of people who did that sort of thing at one point. \n\nIn conclusion, I feel frustrated, slow, and sad. I don‘t even think I can respect other’s opinions on characters anymore atp. ",

    "selftext": "Hi! Quick info fill: In late June me and my family adopted Rhaen (Rhaenyra). I (14F) had been wanting a GSD for a while, and after many presentations and lots of research and conversations, finally convinced my parents to let me get one. We previously had a hound mix (tree-walking coonhound x GSP x English foxhound) that died Oct 2024. My mother did not want a puppy as she works from home, and I and my father wanted a younger dog so we could take them out for exercise and play more than an older dog. We found Rhaen on the Adoptapet website. Her previous owners had this in her description: \"Rhaenyra is a great dog. She is great with children and cats. She has grown up around 3 of my children and my 2 cats. She is a very quiet dog. She doesn’t chew on any furniture and loves to lounge around with us\".\n\nSo to start off, her prey drive! She does well-ish with our (5) cats. It took the cats a couple of months to get used to her, but they do pretty well now; rubbing on her, nose bumps, etc. Yet sometimes she just starts to run after them, especially when the cats come inside or jump off the counters. We live on a lake and therefore have ducks. She will wait for permission (lots and lots of training for this) to run after them, unless they are flying above us or in a neighboring house/yard. If they are not in our backyard she will automatically chase them, not listening to her recall.\n\nContinuing off her recall, I struggle with her training. I try my hardest to get her focused, but she has absolutely no food or toy drive. I have tried so many treats, even the ones the previous owners claimed that she loved, and she likes apples and freeze dried beef liver the most—yet loses interest quickly. She came to my family without any training, including potty training! It was a horrible first month, as we had a (supposed) 2yo large dog doing her business whenever and wherever she wanted. I did get that mostly trained out, and I am currently trying to get my parents to buy one of those bell contraptions for her to let us know when she needs to go out. Anyways, due to no previous training and no drive, it is ever so difficult to train her. She is now able to sit, paw, lay down, come, jump, and go on things… when she chooses. Sometimes she will listen, most times she won’t. I try to be engaging but she is more interested in just laying down. She will focus on me at home more times than not, and when we are completely alone outside but if there are any distractions she will not. My parents refuse to get a long lead, and all I have for her is an old broken retractable leash and a short leash. (around 1yard)\n\nShe is selective with her being reactive (I believe). Her old owners claimed to have taken her to a dog park once a week, so that might be it. A dog or person may pass and she could ignore them, bark (aggressive), lunge (to play), whine (to play), or sometimes even offer a sit. It is so confusing on how she will react. Recently I have been taking her on walks in public places, but I am not sure how to get her to be better with people as she doesn’t focus on a treat.\n\nI would love to get her to a vet, as she has not been to one with the many months that she has been with us. The previous owners never said too much info on her, with no details at all, and they completely cut contact after we got her. We believe she was pretty neglected when she lived with them, as she was extremely skinny, shy, and uninterested with people at all. Getting her to a vet has been a major concern for me as she used to walk weird, and has almost constant diarrhea (once a month for a week). Yet my parents have no desire to get her there. They claim to want me to make an appointment and find the right vet (our past dog died due to an “unknown” reason, and we took him to all the vets in our area and still had no diagnosis and had to put him down) but every time I try they have a problem with it: too far, too much, not reputable, too busy for us, or just a plain no. And since I am too young to drive, and don’t have any money to even pay, I cannot do anything about it.\n\nI am interested in getting her on a raw diet, and my parents are weird about it. One is fine with it yet he first wanted to find a brand that made it, then wanted me to make it myself, and keeps going back and forth. The other claims to want to wait many more months before changing her diet, even though they keep changing what they put on her kibble—which has been changed to Royal Canin GSD Mix. One week it will be Open Farm’s wet food, then a log of Freshpet, then Stella N Chewy’s meat mixes, random wet food brands, and more. What is put on top of her kibble is constantly changing and they claim to want to keep her diet “consistent” to make her diarrhea stop but they don’t even partake in that.\n\nOne main reason I'd like her to be on a raw diet is to help her skin. I am not sure if it is due to allergies, skin issues, or what but on her skin she gets white flecks all over. It is almost dirt like, but it comes from her skin. It will just accumulate if I dont wash her. I know it is bad to wash a GSD often, but if I dont she gets super itchy and covered in the white substance. Its not fleas or ticks as she gets a pill for that, but no clue of what it is.\n\nAs she has been unable to go to a vet, I have no clue of her weight. However, I can kinda feel her ribs through her fur, which I have heard is a good weight. My parents claim that she is way too skinny, but I know she isn’t anything severe—but please tell me if she is! My parents keep feeding her much more than I ask them to, and I cannot do anything over that as my father feeds her super early in the morning. I do try to pick up her food whenever I wake up which is any time between 10 minutes and 4 hours after she has been fed. And since they are my parents, I have no control over that even though I have explained my reasonings (weight and food drive). I’d like to form some muscle on her. I try to take her out running, since she isn’t very active I have been trying to build stamina on her so she can actually run for more than a minute. Lately, I have been taking her on at least 2-mile walks once a day, and yes she gets the opportunity to have as much exercise as she wants but she chooses to come inside very quickly. We live in FL so it could be possible that she gets hot, but as any Floridian should know, we have had many cold fronts and her activity levels did not change.\n\nAs mentioned before, we do live on a lake, and I have read that swimming is a great way to exercise and build muscle and stamina, but she absolutely hates the water. I have desensitized her to the sounds of the water sloshing, which was her first fear. And she will run into the lake when chasing a duck, as far as possible till she gives up; but will not go in any other time. So, and I know the amount of people who will get mad over this, I forcefully dragged her in. When in the water she obviously wants to get out or be held up by me. When I have her deeper in the water, her bum will sink to the bottom till she is either standing on me or struggling to stay afloat. Our old dog had a life vest, but it barely fits her, so when we put it on her it makes no difference.\n\nNext, her age and breed. I know it is hard to tell but it doesn’t hurt to ask, right? The old owners told us they adopted her in February of 2023 and she was a couple of months old (so almost 3 now); but her greying and activity level suggest otherwise. It is possible for her to be a BYB GSD, but more likely to be a mix and I want to know what y’all think!\n\nLastly, me and my father so badly want her to play with us. Once a blue moon she will pick up her randomly chosen toy (out of many) and play for about 5 minutes; or she will play with my, and just my, hands;and sometimes she will pick up a peaf outside and run around with it. I am perfectly okay with her being mouthy as she doesn’t bite hard at all but it is only for a couple minutes till she gets bored. I know not all dogs are the same, but with getting a working dog breed, no matter what she was mixed with, I was hoping for even a slightly active dog! And she just isn’t anything close to that.\n\nI still love my dog to death and we will not give her up no matter what! Any and all advice is appreciated, and I am willing to try anything possible to help my baby. \nAlso previous owners cut contact as soon as we got her, so asking them about anything is out of the picture. Thank you so much!\nNot quite sure how to work reddit, so this is my third try sorry!",

Redken combo: for once a week, smells great, never felt my scalp this clean. Conditioner is okay, haven't seen much difference, softer hair but might be because of other products. Yet to try leave-in Conditioner \n\n🌸2. Loreal combo: Got it for hairfall, didn't see much difference. Hair smells great and softer with the mask.\n\n🌸3. Indewild oil: The smell is amazing, no chip chip. Too early to spot any difference in hairfall. Will update once I finish the bottle.\n\n🌸4. Indewild lipbalm: Love it more than Laneige, thick consistency, I recently got chapped lips, stays for long, smells like caramel coffee, maybe not going back to Laneige lip balm\n\n🌸5. TO Peel: For the tanning, used it once on hand, no irritation as of now, felt a bit softer after washing it off. Not gonna use it on face as I'm not using any actives because skin is skinning rn.\n\n🌸6. TO Hair Serum: Wanted to try this, didn't feel oily on scalp, good for my scalp type, no smell, gave that cooling sensation when I put it on scalp.\n\n🌸7. 52 Sundaze Mist: My 3rd bottle, best thing ever for reapplication, it has strong rose fragrance but tbh my skin is okay with it. It's lightweight, no chip chip, perfect dewy look for oily skin girlies. I hated Asaya spray for my skin.\n\n🌸8. FormularX barrier cream &amp; sunscreen: Gems! 2nd tube of moisturiser, best one ever for me, reduced my texture, felt really soft overtime, and no heavy feeling. I hate heavy moisturisers and always go for gel, not even gel creme as they make me look like oily pan. Yet to try this sunscreen but loved the texture and finish. \n\nIf anyone's curious, he got me that bottle. He loves telling shayaris to me but for him, I'm his shayari.",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone\n\nI don't know why but I really need to take this off my chest.  \nWhen I was 15 I wanted to be a nutritionist, so I did a BSc in Biology and last March I completed a MSc in Human Nutrition (which is what you normally do here in Italy to became a nutritionist). The only issue is that, at the beggining of my 2 year of Master's I undesrtood  I hated a lot of things concerning being a nutritionist, so I used my Erasmus in Spain to do a 10 month internship in a research lab and do my dissertation there (which came out as one of the best dissertations of my course).\n\nThe big problems started when I completed my Master's degree as, not being a student anymore, the Spanish lab couldn't have me there and they couldn't hire me neither.\n\nI passed 4 months looking for a job/internship/PhD in a lab but I only got two interviews.\n\nThe first one told me he had no room for me, the other one, an italian researcher in Sweden, told me I was a prefect match for him but that he ran out of budget so we had to find a grant, which we didn't really find...\n\nLater I found an internship in a Ice-Cream company in R&amp;D but I'm just doing labeling and packaging so it's nothing about what I studied and now that the internship it's ending I don't even know I they want to hire me or not... \n\nFortunally I decided to pursue a MSc in Bioinformatics, and next Thursday I'm gonna have a meeting with the italian researcher in Sweden, hoping to find a way to do an internship at his lab as a student.\n\n  \nThis could sound as a bittersweet story with a good end but the only problem it's that right now I feel really sick by anxiety. What I mean is that I am really afraid that the researcher couldn't have the budget again to take me at his lab and even if he had budget that he couldn't hire me after I graduate again in Bioinformatics. So that I would have to start again to do applications only to get rejected by everyone as I don't have 2+ years of experience...\n\n  \nI feel miserable because I don't know what to do with my life, I did tons of applications but it looks like nobody wants me, not even for a shit-paid job as nobody values my experience as enough to deserve to be hired.\n\nI feel like all I did until now brought me into nothing and I feel distraught..\n\n  \nI don't know if I should start another Master's again, maybe in Northern Europe (DTU in Copenhagen for example) as I have some formers Bachelor's colleagues that told me they had the opportunity to work while studying there so that they had a better CV to be hired later...\n\nI really don't know what to do, I just want to work, I would just want to have someone that gives me a job in the scientific field and I feel like every second that passes without being hired is a lost second which is gonna have a impact on my future, on my next jobs ecc...\n\nSorry for the shitty story and maybe for the shitty english I just wrote this in a rush",

    "title": "A real, actual Lesson in marketing a business",
    "selftext": "Hello, all available or bored entrepreneurs,\n\nGosh, we're tired of all the AI slop these days. All these 'success stories' about 'How I scaled 600 businesses with just a candle and 2.6 seconds of work a day #passiveincome' yadda yadda.\n\nWell, thankfully, I'm here to deliver a marketing fundamentals lesson today to entrepreneurs who are looking to scale a product/application or consider themselves D2C or B2C businesses.\n\n**Why do you give a sh\\*t?**\n\nWell, silly billys, you want to grow your business without having to throw your sweaty socks at the wall and watch them stick.\n\n**Who the f\\*ck are you?**\n\nOH SORRY! I forgot to introduce myself. My name is \\*\\*\\*\\*. I run a Marketing Agency (BOOOO HISSS) that focuses on consumer psychology, strategic sustainable growth over time and long-term brand vision (yay, buzzwords!).\n\nI have a PhD in Neuromarketing, MSc (not the cruise line) in Consumer Psychology and a good old standard BSc in Applied Marketing! HUZZAH! I've worked in marketing for 12 years now, 2 of those running my own business, which I consider successful. Y'know... cause I'm still alive.\n\n*And no, I'm not here to sell you a course, an ebook, or some “rewire your mind for $99\" spiritual awakening nonsense. This is free. Touch grass.*\n\n**Can you hurry up?**\n\n*Sorry. I yap.*\n\nADHD? Marketing brain? Trauma from Facebook Ads Manager? Who knows. ¯\\\\\\_(ツ)\\_/¯\n\nThe lesson I'm going to teach you today is about solving a basic business growth arithmetic problem. Don't worry, this is, somehow, relevant.\n\nAnswer this question (it's a toughie):\n\nIs it easier to:\n\nA) Sell to 1 person.  \nB) Sell to 250 people.\n\nTake those damn fingers off the buzzers, it's a trick question! Of course, it's easier to sell to one person, right? Well, that's actually the concept we're going to be learning today. It is a basic one...so if you know this then...go you...I guess? Let others learn!\n\nAnd yet founders keep choosing Option B like it’s a personality trait...\n\n# Why most founders fail at growth\n\nBecause they're a bit dumb and try to scale volume before they scale **distribution**.\n\nThey optimise ads, funnels, landing pages, onboarding, pricing, ROAS or whatever…  \n…when the real bottleneck is:\n\nYou’re trying to sell to individual humans one by one, like a 1400s market trader.\n\nBusinesses grow fast when they borrow an **audience**.\n\nIf your entire strategy is “drive more traffic,” woohoo! Congratulations, you’ve invented a very expensive treadmill.\n\n# LESSON 1: B2C isn't really B2C\n\nThis is a hard pill to swallow. You spend a lot of time refining a product/app, you have the ideal customer profile sorted, and then you try some paid ads and...no one is buying? Why could that possibly be? You're targeting everyone! It's a product/app FOR EVERYONE?!\n\nThe problem is that you do not have authority or leverage to sell. Even if you do sell, the level of trust one customer can provide to you is minuscule. It doesn't move the needle very much. Psychologically, that interferes with decision-making. You aren't legitimate. And in a world full of AI slop, *that becomes you facing your business' mortality.*\n\nNow let me crush your dreams real quick:\n\n**Reality Check (founders hate this one simple trick)**\n\nYour product is not enough.  \nYour ads are not enough.  \nYour “great idea” is definitely not enough.\n\nWhat wins today is **distribution**.\n\n**But \\*\\*\\*\\*, what do I do?**\n\nWell, kitten, you're trying to sell to too many people. No, don't go niching down your META ads to contain 58 interests. What we actually want to do is reframe how you see your business. Your business product/service is a tool that solves a problem. It might not be a particularly pertinent problem, but it still exists. And so, it becomes easier to leverage an already existing audience through partnerships and referral schemes (that's right, B2B) than it does to actually specifically target people to buy a product, especially low ticket items.\n\n# Mini-Framework: The “One = Many” Growth Model\n\nAsk yourself three questions:\n\n1. **Who already has my customers?**\n2. **How can I give them a reason to send customers to me?**\n3. **How can I make it brain-dead f\\*cking easy for them to do it?**\n\nIf you can answer all three, congrats, you don’t have a growth problem anymore.\n\nBut you do have a ***distribution engine.***\n\n**Take this scenario:**\n\nYou have a fitness app, you charge $5 per month, and you need 2000 users per month to make it profitable. You currently throw sh\\*t at the wall on META ads and are not really getting anywhere (and it's not really because of the ads)\n\nWhere is that target market? Well, let's look at a business model that gets regular customers year-on-year.\n\nUniversities/Colleges: The average number of students enrolled at any one time in a US college is roughly 6,400. Of those, an educated guess using averages can deduce that roughly 40% of those may have a gym membership, and 75% of those consider themselves 'moderately active or more'\n\nRight, so one silly little College has a potential customer base of \\*checks calculator\\* *a lot of people* (4,800) every 3 or so years. Right, so if you partnered with that university, offered them a cut of your fitness app for each referral download, say you gave them a generous $1.50 per download... And say you'd only manage to reach 50% of them.\n\n**2400 x $3.50 =** ***$8,400 per month***\\*.\\*\n\nAnd that is just 1 university. There are almost 6,000 post-secondary institutions in the US alone...and that is just **one industry.**\n\nSo you see, the math just maths.\n\nIt is significantly easier to partner or sell to one business than it is to sell to 2400 potential clients. Right?\n\nAnd before someone screams “bUt ThAt WoN’t WoRk FoR mY bUsInEsS,” I’ve done this exact playbook in fitness, fintech, edtech, SaaS, and even a bloody pet subscription box. It works because humans are humans.\n\n# What you can actually do yesterday/tomorrow:\n\n* Make a list of 30 or so organisations that already hold your target audience.\n* Identify what they care about: revenue share, retention, student engagement, staff benefits, hooking up with each other, whatever.\n* Build a **simple referral or revenue-share offer**.\n* Give them a snazzy pre-written email template so promotion takes 2 damn minutes.\n* Run one pilot.\n* Adjust.\n* Scale *horizontally* to similar organisations.\n\nThat’s it.  \nThat’s how almost every “overnight success” actually grows. It's crazy, right?\n\nWho knew 'brand deals' were more about 'deals with the brand' than 'dealing with a brand'?\n\n**CONCLUSION OR SOMETHING:**\n\nIf you want to scale a B2C business without losing your actual f\\*cking mind, stop trying to hunt 10,000 customers.\n\nMake one partner hunt them for you.\n\nMaths maths = leverage leverages.\n\n# Q - \"Who already has your entire audience sitting in a neat little box, and why haven’t you kicked their door in (politely) and asked for a revenue-share yet?\"\n\n**TL;DR:**\n\n* Stop trying to sell your cute little product to 10,000 random civilians like some feral street vendor.\n* Partner with ONE organisation that already owns the crowd.\n* Congrats, you’ve just solved B2C growth.\n* B2C is just B2B wearing a trench coat and pretending to be sexy.",

I fucking hate it because “I don’t want to be pregnant because it’s pregnancy” isn’t a good enough reason to not get pregnant. Being an entire fucking man isn’t a good enough reason. If you have a womb you gotta use it at least once and three times for good measure. Why does axoloms site suggest it in one of the articles. They sell dick and balls???\n\nMy period has been going on for 11 days. That’s a new record. It’s reminding me of how I’ll never be a dad. I don’t want to risk not feeling like a real father /man and protecting that onto my child, especially if they were a boy. It’s just my body betraying me and reminding me of how pregnant I could get.

Of course, my son in law didn’t see the charm in it and called someone who said they would come and not kill them but take them out and release them in nature. 🙄 I’m old but not that old. We live in the suburbs of Los Angeles, you are gonna drive around all day with them and then take them and release them ? Nope, you are just going to put them down! I researched and found they hate the scent of Coyote urine so we got some from Home Depot, put it on chunks of those big yellow sponges and threw them in the attic. During the night she moved her babies out and I hope they had a great life. Not sure this is news to this community, but just in case someone needs to know. It really works and nobody gets hurt. They come to see me every night  not those I don’t think  but who knows 🤫 ",

And it made me realise how pathetic it is how we rely on it so much. I had people message me saying \"oh my god I wondered what happened\" people are so lazy they couldn't be bothered even texting and trying to find my number or asking a friend🙄  anyway, my problem is that I tried adding all my friends back etc \nSome I haven't seen in years and some I used to party with when I was younger and hung out with on a regular basis, we were all friends. Some of these people have kids now, my partner and I don't because of my medical condition and I choose to be childfree. *I have cystic fibrosis and had a double lung transplant and liver transplant*\n\nI was friends with these friends on Facebook prior to my accounts being disabled. \n\nNow I have set up my new accounts, half these people will not accept my friend request and it just \"message\" when I checked their profile. \n\nOf course, I feel sad and like nobody wants anything to do with me anymore. I cannot think of a single thing I could have done. \nI struggling with friends no longer wanting to be a part of my life and just giving me no explanation as to why they don't want to make that connection on Facebook. I really hate my brain at times. I just wish people would actually want to remain friends with me and actually see me sometimes in person. I feel so lonely lately. I get that not everyone understands cystic fibrosis and the trauma I have related to that, I just feel like if I was to die of course everyone would care yet they don't in real life.  Is it a kid thing? Now a few have kids and they feel like they can't connect with me because my partner and I don't want any? I don't know.\n\nI just feel so left out and have no one like I used to in my early 20s. \n\nThanks for reading if you made it this far. And hope everyone is having a good weekend.",

And even though the blades themselves felt less sharp, it felt super uncomfortable and draggy for the blades to go across my face in the shave.

Wondering why every crowd funding campaign ends mostly in abject failure, recriminations, finger pointing quarts of Ben &amp; Jerry’s Phish Food (don’t judge, I have my ways you have yours).\n\nSeriously though let’s talk about it honestly. I have been getting a lot of questions about funding documentary films so I figured, let’s talk about and answer your questions as best I can.\n\nBecause here’s the truth that no platform, mass marketing guru, crowdfunding magician, or filmmaking professor will ever tell you:\n\nMost documentary crowdfunding campaigns fail. It’s just the fact.\n\nMine included. Many, Many times.\n\nI’ve run Kickstarters, Indiegogos, and now three Seed&amp;Spark campaigns.\n\nAbout 95% of them failed miserably, and when. I say miserably I mean no donations at all, well I did get $200 on Rising Tides but that was from my mother. I had to give it back to her when the campaign ended.\n\nAnd not because the films were bad, but because I truly had no idea what I was doing for a change. I was under the impression that an important doc (well important to me) would by osmosis draw donations out of the goodness of the people who support this cause.\n\nBoy I could not have been more wrong if I had deliberately tried to fail.\n\nHere are the big lessons I learned the hard way:\n\n1. Don’t launch a campaign before you have a social network.\n\nMost filmmakers have:\n\n* 6 friends\n* a Facebook page from 2014\n* an Instagram with three pictures of their dog, cat, goldfish (they happen to be very photogenic)\n* and exactly zero online presence\n\n…and then they’re shocked when their Kickstarter raises $200, (from your mother).\n\nCrowdfunding is not about money, it’s about an audience you’ve already built. Now I don’t know about you, but I am a 60 year old (56 when we made Rising Tides)  Gen-Xer who does not tip toe naturally through the garden that is social media and on line communities.\n\nIf you don’t have one yet, you better start building one before you launch. Trust me this much I know, Well I know now. Better late than never.\n\n2. Have someone else run the campaign.\n\nFilmmakers cannot. direct, shoot, edit, produce, run social media, build community, AND manage a fundraiser at the same time. Firstly, that’s like 9 different jobs, and if you are a one-man band as I have been for most of my career, social media is the last thing on my Gen-X socially inept mind. These things do not come naturally to me at all. Which is a large part why my previous campaigns failed miserably (pictures of dogs, cats, fish, and motorcycles not withstanding however I can rock an Oxford comma with the best of them!)\n\nYou need a second person.\n\nIdeally someone who:\n\n* posts daily\n* answers messages\n* motivates donors\n* and keeps you sane\n\nOn *Denied!* that person is Zee, my hero, my savior, my son’s partner, and frankly it’s the smartest move I’ve made.\n\n  \n3. Ignore the hype. Platforms exaggerate success rates. It’s their Job. Don’t hate them for it, just don’t believe it either.\n\nKickstarter, Indiegogo, Seed\\&amp;Spark; every one of them will tell you that\n\n*“campaigns with a strong story thrive.”*\n\nBullshit.\n\nCampaigns with:\n\n✔ an existing audience\n\n✔ a network\n\n✔ a team\n\n✔ daily engagement\n\n…thrive. Maybe. But it has to work better than not doing anything at  all, right ?\n\nEven with all of that it’s still a struggle. Getting people to donate is like trying to get that really cool toy out of the bundle of crappy ones in the that game with flimsy crane arm.\n\n4. Why most doc filmmakers end up on Seed&amp;Spark.\n\nWe chose Seed&amp;Spark for one very unsexy but essential reason:\n\nThere is no platform fee. It’s also really geared towards filmmakers as opposed to Kickstarter and Indiegogo.\n\nKickstarter &amp; Indiegogo take a big cut whether you hit your goal or not. Let me tell you 10-15% of your precious $200 dollars leaves you with bupkiss, as my grandfather would say.\n\nSeed&amp;Spark only releases funds if you hit 80%; which protects you from being stuck with $500 on a $15,000 campaign.\n\nThis is our third S&amp;S campaign, and honestly it’s the first time I finally feel like we have what we need to make it actually work:\n\n* a community – Thanks to Z\n* a social presence – Thanks to Z\n* a real plan – Thanks to Z\n* and the infrastructure – well Zee is our infrastructure (IMBD credit and everything).\n\nMind you this is sheer speculation as we are literally right in the middle of this round of fundraising as I write this. Which is why I was inspired to write this AMA now. Is that too META? Am I using the word META correctly?  Possibly not? Is me asking if I am using the word META too META? OK I will stop with the META now.\n\nWhere was I?\n\nOh ya, having someone other than you handle your social media. That could be the difference maker. I will let you know, probably here. (Not here in this post but on my Reddit thing)\n\n5. Set a realistic goal. Please. I beg you.\n\nFilmmakers just love to ask for tons of money for a film they haven’t even started shooting. Often with no track record.\n\nJust Don’t. Seriously.\n\nStart small, build momentum, use whatever you can get to get to larger private donors later.\n\nThat’s our plan with *Denied!* early Seed&amp;Spark funds to launch production, then leverage our PBS distribution relationship to unlock larger donors who support public-broadcast projects.\n\nAnd here’s something *nobody* told me for the first decade and a half of my career (and frankly, I only learned it last week myself): getting a fiscal sponsor can open fundraising doors you didn’t even know existed.\n\nMost indie filmmakers have *no idea* what a fiscal sponsor is, I sure didn’t. In a nutshell there are charitable organizations, the one we are working with is the IDA (International Documentary Association) they are a 501c3 and their sole purpose is to receive charitable donations from grants, philanthropies, and private donors and funnel it through their 501c3 and then distribute the funds to the filmmakers. They take between 5-7% for doing this nice thing for us. What that means to you and me and this is important; if you are looking for documentary grant money, most grants will not give money to a person, like you and me,. They will however give money to IDA for a documentary they believe in. I know this sound like money laundering, but it is perfectly legal and you retains 100% creative control and ownership of your film.  Fiscal Sponsorship, it’s what’s for dinner.\n\nSo, once you have a fiscal sponsor, you can:\n\n·       receive tax-deductible donations (huge deal for serious funders)\n\n·       apply for grants that require nonprofit status\n\n·       approach donors who *only* give through 501(c)(3) channels\n\n·       make your campaign look more professional and trustworthy\n\nIt is, hands down, one of the biggest out of the box  tools for indie documentary fundraising. And no crowdfunding platform will tell you this because it doesn’t benefit them. But if you want to raise real money (not just $200 from your mom and $500 from your aunt who hates your tattoos), fiscal sponsorship could be the lifeboat your film needs to get financed. Again, we are treading these waters for the first time ourselves, so I will keep you all posted on how that process progresses. .\n\nI know a lot of you have asked me about fundraising and it is truly the suckiest topic to talk about in the doc filmmaking world. No one has it easy not the folks who get their films to Sundance and SXSW, the guys who sell to the streamers and this guy (me), who even though his film will be on PBS this week, spent 20K of his own money (well my wife’s, I mean our money) to get it made with hopes of a return.  There is no money. When I finally crack that code I promise I will post it here.\n\nHere are the three things to bring down the cost of your self funded doc.\n\n1.     Own as much of your own gear as possible. It does not have to be expensive gear either, start small, but, being able to just go out and shoot is **FREE**. I have built up over 6 documentaries a fair bit of kit. But my first three docs were me, one camera, one mic and one light. You can make that work!\n\n2.     Shoot local, Like I said before s local stories can be as compelling as something in Patagonia (nothing against Patagonia, never been there, I am actually not even sure where it is, a product of  the American School system, however I am sure it’s very nice, but you know, far away. UNLESS in fact you are in Patagonia, then shoot away dear friend.).  Shoot local, sometimes it’s not the story but the storyteller.\n\n3.     Favors: Work for other people for free, build up favors and when you need free help they will come. (Sort of “if you build it they will come” vibe) Working for free is not a sin. We all did it, I still do it occasionally when it’s a project I feel strongly about. It’s good karma and it will come back to you!\n\nAsk Me Anything.\n\nWant to know:\n\n* which platform is best for *your* film? When all is said and done Seed &amp; Spark is tailored to filmmakers, so it is the best option I think as you will not get stuck with funds you can’t use and pissed off contributors (never say donors, for some reason, I don’t know why,i t makes people itchy)\n* how to build an audience from zero? That is exactly what we have been working on, with Denied!. I can tell you what we have done so far and what seems to be working and what has yet bear fruit.\n* how to avoid predatory “consultants”, “happy helpers who want you to give them money to help you”, scam artists?  I literally, just this past week had this smooth operator offer to share with me his wisdom, knowledge, unending support and contacts to help our “crucial” film project on Seed and Spark for the low low price of $1500 up front, but I am told the return on my investment will pay for my film. Hmm Turnip Truck --&gt;Me? I don’t think so. I can see them coming from a mile away. Reach out if you see them sniffing around,  \n* how to frame your campaign so you don’t look like you’re asking for money when you are in fact asking for money. Truly as Doc filmmakers we hate this part. But it is the necessary evil to let us do that part that we love. Making movies.\n\nAsk away, I’ve failed at this enough times to finally understand how to almost do it right. Dogs, cats, Goldfish, motorcycles, drums, guys and girls with swords, notwithstanding. ",

    "title": "Condemnation of Intra-Subaltern Patriarchal Violence. (Recent few posts)",
    "selftext": "Let's talk about a poison spreading in our community (Past few posts). Let's talk about the Avarna man who, instead of directing his rage at the system that crushes him, turns it on the Avarna woman. The one who sees a sister, a mother, a daughter in a relationship with a Savarna man and sneers \"She craves Savarna validation\" lol. The one who blames her for the very oppression they both suffer; It's sad.\n\nMates, listen. What you are doing is not protection. It is the ultimate betrayal. It is a sickness and it is time for a diagnosis.\n\nI saw a post that addressed the Avarna men in the sub-reddit charging Avarna women with \"craving for Savarna validation\"; This is so pathologizing &amp; it is showing a catastrophic failure of emancipatory consciousness. The men here are engaging in dialectical perversion wherin you guys, rather than confronting the oppressing structure, have literally become it's zealous micro-enforcers. It's absolutely disgusting. \n\nThe material reality is that the Savarna male occupies a position of consolidated capital be it economic, social or/and symbolic. His desirability is not a natural attribute but a social relation reflecting this accumulation. Your accusation against the Avarna woman is a classic case of Horizontal hostility; Literally a displacement of rage from the vertical axis of power (Brahminical patriarch) to the horizontal plane of the oppressed (Avarna woman). This is a blatant misrecognition that is transforming potential comrade in the struggle against caste-capital into a scapegoat for the collective powerlessness experienced by you guys. You're literally attacking the symptom i.e Relational Dynamics, while \"protecting\" the dieases i.e the Caste System. YEAH PROTECTING! \n\nYou HAVE to understand that Caste System, at it's core, is a biopolitical project which is predicated on the meticulous management of life through endogamy. The ULTIMATE 'crime' in order is the transgression of sexual and marital boundaries, which threatens the purity-based logic of the entire structure. You guys who polices the Avarna woman’s choices have PROFOUNDLY internalized this biopolitical mandate. You guys have literally become \"Subaltern Policemen\"; Agent who, without coercion from the state or the dominant caste, voluntarily disciplines the bodies of his own community to conform to the very rules that ensure its subordination. Your accusations are DISCURSIVE acts that is reproducing the truth-regime of the caste i.e  that women's bodies are property whose circulation must be controlled to maintain the collective's symbolic boundaries. PLEASE RE-READ THIS LAST POINT; YOU ARE ENGAGING IN THIS ONLY. \n\n\"Craving for Savarna Validation\", WHAT IS THIS? This statement is literally libidinal discharge from you guys, shame; Act of ressentiment i.e a poisonous, reactive affect born from a sense of impotence. You guys are denied access to the forms of capital and recognition enjoyed by the Savarna, experiences the Avarna woman's choice as a narcissistic injury. You guys are projecting your own sense of emasculation &amp; social inadequacy onto Avarna Women and Pathologizing it as their \"craving\". Disgusting. These projections must've been providing you perverse pleasure, yeah? Otherwise they literally make, NO SENSE. THINK ABOUT IT YOURSELVES;  The momentary, euphoric sensation of moral superiority and righteous indignation that you force on Avarna Women. A cheap psychic victory that compensates for YOUR political and social defeats, lmao.  A toxic libidinal fix that avoids you the actual, painful work of confronting your own position within the oppressive structures. \n\nI am convinced that you guys just have Bad Faith, at this point. You guys flee from  the anguish of your own freedom and responsibility by casting the Avarna woman as the inauthentic actor. They are TRANSCEDANT SUBJECTS CAPABLE OF MAKING THEIR OWN CHOICES IN A CONSTRAINED SITUATION. Instead, you reduce them to mere immanent object,  THIS IS COMMUNAL BETRAYAL! You are denying them agency and literally constructing them as passive vessels for pathological desires. Please focus on your own complicity in the patriarchal order. \n\nYour condemnation is just bigoted &amp; very-very disappointing to even look at; Apotheosis of Alienation. You guys are just actively reproducing the violence of caste-patriarchal order as it's VICTIMS by the way. PUNCH ABOVE NOT SIDEWAYS AND/OR BELOW! Criticize the bigoted Savarna's who do these vile things instead of blaming it on the women in our community. \n\nConcluding my saturday musing here. VERY-VERY Disappointed on some of the comments peddled by Avarna Men.",

    "title": "How Inequality and the Consolidation of Housing Ruined Every Empire Since Rome",
    "selftext": "One might charitably assume that a nation which so loudly proclaims itself exceptional would bother to crack open a history book now and then. But charity, like affordable housing, is in rather short supply these days.\n\nThe pattern is almost mathematically precise. Rome gorged itself on latifundia — vast estates worked by slaves while citizen farmers were squeezed into urban squalor. The French aristocracy clutched their feudal holdings right up until they lost their heads over it.\n\nTsarist Russia’s landlords presided over a peasantry that eventually decided pitchforks and revolution beat rent collection. Mexico’s hacienda system lasted until it didn’t.\n\nEach empire, in its own idiom, made the same fatal error: they allowed land — the most fundamental resource, the literal ground beneath one’s feet — to become a chip in a casino run by oligarchs.\n\n**America, ever the precocious student, has learned these lessons backwards.**\n\n[**https://medium.com/@hrnews1/how-inequality-and-the-consolidation-of-housing-ruined-every-empire-since-rome-1ae382d86199**](https://medium.com/@hrnews1/how-inequality-and-the-consolidation-of-housing-ruined-every-empire-since-rome-1ae382d86199)\n\n# The New Latifundia\n\nWhere Rome had its patrician estates, we have private equity firms buying up single-family homes by the tens of thousands. Where feudal lords collected tithes, we have hedge funds collecting rent — remote, algorithmic, pitiless. Bill Gates is now the largest private farmland owner in the United States, which would be merely curious if it weren’t accompanied by the wholesale disappearance of the family farm, the depopulation of rural America, and the transformation of agriculture into a subsidiary of finance capital.\n\nThis isn’t conspiracy theory. It’s listed on the stock exchange.\n\nThe numbers don’t whisper — they scream. Homeownership rates among the young have cratered. Rural towns are hollowed out, their economies extracted like ore from a mine. Meanwhile, real estate investment trusts — those charming acronyms that hide so much ugliness — continue their acquisition spree, commodifying shelter as if it were pork belly futures.\n\nOne might ask: Has any civilization ever survived when housing becomes a speculative asset rather than a human right?\n\nThe answer is no. But Americans don’t do history; they do Netflix.\n\n# Rome: The Original Playbook\n\nLet us begin where all roads lead — to Rome, naturally. In the second and first centuries before Christ, something quietly catastrophic was happening to the Republic.\n\nThe patricians and generals, flush with conquest and plunder, began accumulating latifundia on a scale that would make a modern hedge fund manager weep with envy. These weren’t farms in any meaningful sense — they were industrial plantations worked by slaves, the machinery of empire grinding up both the conquered abroad and the citizenry at home.\n\nThe small farmers who had built Rome, who had staffed its legendary legions, found themselves dispossessed. They couldn’t compete with slave labor.\n\nThey couldn’t match the economies of scale. Their land was bought up, seized through debt, or simply absorbed by the ever-expanding estates of the aristocracy. So they drifted to Rome itself, swelling the urban poor, dependent on grain doles and gladiatorial spectacles — bread and circuses, as the formula went.\n\nThe political consequences were spectacular. The Gracchi brothers tried land reform and were murdered for their trouble. Marius and Sulla turned politics into civil war.\n\nThen came Caesar and Pompey, and finally the whole Republican apparatus collapsed under the weight of its own contradictions. The problem wasn’t external enemies — those the legions handled quite efficiently. The problem was internal rot, the kind that spreads when a society decides that productive citizens are less valuable than consolidated wealth.\n\n**Sound familiar? It should.**\n\n# China: When the Mandate Breaks\n\nJump forward a few centuries and eastward to the Han Dynasty. By the second and third centuries of the Common Era, aristocratic families had achieved something remarkable: they’d managed to monopolize farmland through the elegant mechanism of debt peonage. Peasants borrowed to survive bad harvests, then found themselves unable to repay, and suddenly their land belonged to someone else. Generation after generation, the process continued until a tiny elite owned everything and everyone else owned nothing.\n\nThe peasants, demonstrating a keen grasp of political economy, revolted. The Yellow Turban Rebellion of 184 CE wasn’t some random spasm of violence — it was a direct response to land concentration. And when the Han Dynasty fell shortly thereafter, it ushered in three centuries of warlord chaos, fragmentation, and collapse.\n\nThe Chinese, at least, learned something from this. Every subsequent dynasty understood that land reform wasn’t optional — it was existential. Peasants with a stake in the system defend it. Peasants with nothing to lose burn it down.\n\n**The lesson apparently hasn’t crossed the Pacific.**\n\n# England: Enclosing the Commons\n\nMedieval England offers a particularly instructive case study in how to destroy social cohesion through property rights. The enclosure movement — that bureaucratic-sounding phrase that disguises genuine horror — involved privatizing communal lands that peasants had used for centuries. What was once shared became exclusively owned. What sustained villages became consolidated estates.\n\nThe peasants, understandably, were less than thrilled. The Peasants’ Revolt of 1381 was a direct response to this dispossession, combined with poll taxes and feudal obligations. **Wat Tyler and John Ball** led an army of the dispossessed to London, demanding an end to serfdom and the redistribution of Church lands. They were, naturally, crushed — but the revolt cracked feudalism’s facade permanently.\n\nThe enclosures continued, of course, because profit is more persuasive than justice. But each wave of enclosure produced social upheaval, migration, poverty, and rage. **The Industrial Revolution’s** urban hellscapes were filled with people driven off land their ancestors had worked for generations. This wasn’t progress — it was organized theft with better paperwork.\n\nModern America is essentially running the same script, except now we use terms like “market efficiency” and “property rights” instead of “enclosure.” The mechanism is identical. **The hedge funds buying up neighborhoods are simply digital landlords, enclosing the commons of affordable housing.**\n\n# Spain: Imperial Stagnation\n\nThe Spanish Empire at its height controlled vast territories, extracted obscene amounts of gold and silver from the Americas, and presided over a domestic economy that was, to put it charitably, catastrophically dysfunctional. **The nobility and the Church owned massive latifundios while the peasantry owned nothing.** The aristocracy paid virtually no taxes — that was for little people — and invested nothing in productive enterprise.\n\n**The result?** Persistent poverty, revolts in Castile and Naples, and across the colonial territories. Spain became dependent on imported grain while sitting on enormous tracts of arable land, because those lands were locked up in aristocratic estates producing nothing efficiently. The empire stagnated, declined, and eventually collapsed, not from external conquest but from internal sclerosis.\n\nThe lesson is almost comically obvious: you cannot run a sustainable economy when wealth and land are concentrated in the hands of a rentier class that produces nothing and extracts everything. Yet here we are, with an American economy increasingly dominated by financial extraction rather than productive investment, by rent-seeking rather than value creation.\n\n**The Spanish nobles at least had the excuse of not having history books about Spanish nobles to read. What’s our excuse?**\n\n# France: Let Them Eat Cake\n\nThe French Ancien Régime deserves special attention for the sheer elegant stupidity of its design. The nobility and clergy — perhaps two percent of the population — owned roughly forty percent of the land and paid almost no taxes. The burden of financing the state fell almost entirely on the peasantry and the emerging bourgeoisie, who owned less land, produced most of the wealth, and were milked accordingly.\n\nThis arrangement was, predictably, unsustainable. Food shortages hit, bread prices soared, and the peasants — who had been watching aristocrats frolic at Versailles while they starved — decided they’d had quite enough. **The French Revolution wasn’t some ideological abstraction**. It was a direct response to land concentration, tax injustice, and aristocratic parasitism.\n\nThe guillotine wasn’t elegant, but it was efficient. And the message was clear: when you fence off the earth and hoard the harvest, eventually the dispossessed come for your head.\n\nModern America doesn’t have formal nobility — we have billionaires, which is basically the same thing with worse taste. We don’t have feudal estates — we have investment portfolios and real estate empires. But the mechanism of extraction is identical: a tiny elite controls the fundamental resources, pays minimal taxes through creative accounting, and expects everyone else to be grateful for the privilege of enriching them.\n\n[](https://medium.com/plans?source=upgrade_membership---post_li_non_moc_upsell--1ae382d86199---------------------------------------)\n\n**One wonders how long we think this can last.**\n\n# Russia: The Peasant Question\n\nCzarist Russia took land concentration to genuinely impressive extremes. Less than two percent of the population — the nobility — owned two-thirds of the arable land. Peasants were, until 1861, literally serfs, bound to estates they could never own, working land they could never escape. Even after emancipation, the land distribution was so grotesquely unjust that peasants remained essentially landless, renting at rates that ensured perpetual poverty.\n\n***The result?*** **Famines. Revolts. Repression. More famines. More revolts. And finally, inevitably, revolution.**\n\nThe Bolsheviks didn’t come from nowhere. They emerged from a society that had made life unbearable for the overwhelming majority while a tiny elite lived in spectacular luxury. Lenin’s promise of “peace, land, and bread” wasn’t particularly sophisticated ideology — it was a direct response to the obvious fact that peasants had no land and not enough bread.\n\n**The Romanov dynasty** ended in a basement in Ekaterinburg because they never grasped that you cannot indefinitely preside over mass immiseration while living in palaces. **Well, you can, but only until you can’t.**\n\n**American billionaires might want to take notes, though I suspect they’re too busy buying their fourth yacht.**\n\n# Ireland: The Absent Landlords\n\nThe Irish case is particularly obscene because it combines land concentration with colonial exploitation. Anglo-Irish landlords — many of them absentee, living in England — owned most of Ireland while native Irish were reduced to tenant farmers growing cash crops for export. When the potato blight hit in 1845, those cash crops kept flowing to England while a million Irish starved and another million emigrated.\n\nThis wasn’t a natural disaster. It was policy. The land was producing food — just not for the people who lived on it. The landlords collected rent while tenants died, and the British government wrung its hands about market forces and relief measures that never quite materialized.\n\nThe Great Famine destroyed British legitimacy in Ireland permanently. It took another seventy years, but Irish independence was born in those famine graves.\n\n**You can only extract so much before the system collapses or explodes.**\n\nModern America doesn’t have quite the same colonial dynamic, but we do have a version of it: **absentee corporate landlords extracting wealth from communities they never see, raising rents beyond what local wages can bear, and evicting tenants with the cold efficiency of an algorithm**. The mechanism may be digital rather than colonial, but the cruelty is equivalent.\n\n# Mexico: Tierra y Libertad\n\nThe Porfirio Díaz era in Mexico — 1876 to 1911 — achieved what might be a historical record for land concentration. One percent of the population owned eighty-five percent of the land. One percent. Eighty-five percent.\n\nThe predictable result was the Mexican Revolution, one of the bloodiest upheavals of the twentieth century. Emiliano Zapata’s rallying cry was **“Tierra y Libertad”** — Land and Freedom — because everyone understood that the two were inseparable. Freedom without land ownership is just a different kind of servitude. The revolution cost a million lives and fundamentally restructured Mexican society.\n\nThe lesson, yet again, is obvious: extreme land concentration is not a stable equilibrium. It’s a countdown timer. You can suppress the explosion through force, propaganda, and distraction, but eventually the contradictions become unsustainable.\n\nAmerican land concentration hasn’t yet reached **Porfirian Mexico’s** extremes, but we’re working on it. Private equity firms, institutional investors, and billionaire land barons are systematically buying up property while working families are priced out of ownership. We’re creating a nation of permanent renters presided over by a landlord class that produces nothing and extracts everything.\n\n**Zapata’s ghost is watching with interest.**\n\n# Brazil: The Eternal Postponement\n\nBrazil’s story is instructive because it demonstrates what happens when land reform is perpetually postponed. Enormous fazendas — ranches and plantations — dominated by a few families have characterized Brazilian land ownership for centuries. Despite repeated promises of reform, despite obvious social dysfunction, the concentration persists.\n\nThe consequences have been exactly what you’d expect: rural poverty, urban slums, waves of leftist insurgency, and political instability culminating in military dictatorship from 1964 to 1985. The landless movement in Brazil has been fighting for decades for basic access to land, facing violence, repression, and indifference from a government captured by agricultural interests.\n\nBrazil demonstrates that you can, in fact, sustain land concentration for a very long time if you’re willing to accept endemic poverty, political dysfunction, and periodic authoritarian crackdowns. Whether that constitutes a functioning society is another question entirely.\n\n**The American trajectory is looking increasingly Brazilian**: extreme inequality normalized, political dysfunction accepted as inevitable, and a thin veneer of democracy masking oligarchic control. ***We haven’t quite reached the military dictatorship stage, but give it time.***\n\n# Zimbabwe: The Colonial Hangover\n\nZimbabwe’s case is more recent and more complex, involving post-colonial legacies, racial dynamics, and spectacular mismanagement. But the underlying pattern is familiar: at independence in 1980, the white minority — less than one percent of the population — owned the vast majority of prime agricultural land. For two decades this arrangement persisted, a colonial holdover in an ostensibly independent nation.\n\n**When Robert Mugabe finally implemented land seizures in the 2000s**, he did so chaotically, violently, and disastrously. Productive farms were destroyed, agricultural output collapsed, hyperinflation ensued, and Zimbabwe descended into economic catastrophe.\n\nBut here’s the thing: the land concentration was also unsustainable. There was no good solution, only bad options and worse options. The inherited colonial land distribution guaranteed eventual crisis. Mugabe’s land reform was a disaster, but leaving land ownership unchanged would also have been a disaster — just a slower-moving one.\n\nThe lesson isn’t that land reform is bad. It’s that waiting until the situation is unbearable, then implementing reform incompetently and violently, produces catastrophe. The time for rational, equitable land distribution is before the crisis, not during it.\n\nAmerica is not Zimbabwe, obviously. But we’re creating similar dynamics: an ownership class increasingly divorced from the majority, extracting wealth rather than creating it, and a political system incapable of addressing the fundamental imbalance. **When the crisis comes — and it will — our options will be bad and worse, because we waited too long to choose good.**",

    "selftext": "I’ve never posted on here because my situation has  seemingly improved thanks to staying with my boyfriend most days/nights. However, I’m still being gaslit by my father about a fight we had over a year ago. I was 22 at the time and it was the weekend so of course I wanted to go out like everyone else which typically wasn’t a problem (he started to loosen up ever so slightly around age 20-21). So I go to grab my keys and they’re gone. My parents paid for my car so I just assumed they didn’t want me drinking and driving which is totally fair, so I tell my dad I’m going to call an uber (with my money). All of the sudden he comes in very arrogantly and blocks the doorway to go outside. Mind you he’s a very big man. I was puzzled because we haven’t really fought much around that time nor have I done anything to provoke him. He says “if an uber comes on my property, i will call the police.” Next I suggested having a friend pick me up to which he still stood firm in the doorway. So at this point I realize I’m being held against my will. I didn’t even want to go out partying at this point. I just needed to get OUT of the house. I started with my words but I eventually had to try and physically move him which required some pushing but that only escalated things. He started pushing me back further into the interior of the house. Next thing I know, my mom’s joins in and aids him in blockading me from leaving. I continue to get more physical with my dad (no close hand punches) but I definitely smacked him once or twice and in this fit of rage my mom got caught is the cross fire and got slapped too (enabler). That’s when my dad’s face absolutely dropped. To this day whenever we get in any sort of disagreement he brings up me hitting my mom. He in fact did try to pull this stunt again not too long after and I ended up calling the police. The police had to talk to him like a 5 year old and explain that he can’t hold me here against my will and he’s never tried again. I just don’t appreciate being made out to be some monster and abuser for something he caused. I’m never violent and never had a history of violence, but you can’t expect me to not fight back when you’re denying me access to leave the property.",

    "selftext": "Edmund navigates through another day in a place he’s grown accustomed to, for the past years training as a soldier, along the barracks. As he wakes through another session filled with sparring amid the training grounds, he trips on the weathered mud composing the ground as he’s knocked down with the blunt weaponry they utilize for their training. With his red and swollen face perhaps from a prior strike, instead of spending the time fighting as usual, contemplative forces come after his thoughts as he begins to fixate meagerly towards his upfront, thoughts regarding the flashing of steels from the trainees’ swords seemingly disturb him to the point of not wanting to get up; goosebumps suddenly fill the brim of his skin, as he seems to recollect something.\n\nAs Edmund spectates, he notices the fingers on his right hand numbing; as he releases his grip on his sword; as it lays flattened inward the ground. He checks underneath his right glove just to inspect such signs of sudden warning, and yet sharp pains akin to pins and needles partake from his right arm down his hand as he moves the glove upwards. As the glove reaches the tip, he begins to see unnatural amounts of calluses formed underneath the surfaces of his hand, as his pupils lighten from their dilution just prior. The fruits of my labor. He whispers with a subtle breath of relief.\n\n“What are you doing just laying there?” A fellow trainee asks Edmund suddenly.\n\n“I can barely feel my legs, neither my hand or my face.” He replies with disdain palpable in his voice.\n\n“We’re in training, you’re supposed to get up regardless.” The trainee replies.\n\n“That’s what I’ve been doing all the time I’ve spent here, right now let me just breathe.” Edmund responds with immediacy.\n\n“Alright, but do understand that we’re going to be placed on nightwatch by the prison camp when the night comes.” The trainee says in agreement. “A little more training wouldn’t help against some sudden attack. He continues.\n\n“Then join me in breathing, at least we’re going to be able to bear the march later on without our legs pulling us down.” Edmund is still despondent with getting up.\n\n“You do have a point.” The trainee’s left enticed as he sits near Ed.\n\nA burst of shouting from their captain begins to ring and pierce Edmund’s eardrums, as a sudden call to action meant for trainees, fully grabs his attention. The captain goes into detail about their operation along the prison camp, as they’re tasked for nightwatch. He contemplates whether there would be a day he’s able to exude the same amount of gripping charisma as his captain, yet with his sudden flinching against the steels, as well as the strange recollection he had earlier, he’s aware that he’s far off in terms of progress. He gets up as the trainees begin to form lines towards their march onto the prison camp.\n\nAs they’ve reached the prison camp, they’re tasked to go on rotations for the nightwatch; Edmund as well as other trainees are told to rest so that they won't pass out during the time of their station. He begins to clean his sword with cloth, contemplating for the time he’d be able to protect the people he cares about; the fear of rust might hinder such possibility. His eardrums begin to collect murmurs from outside his tent; composed of trainees resting for the night though outside their tents. He overhears remarks of mockery pertaining to him, going on about how sloppy he is in terms of combat, being told by the same person who caused his face to become swollen. He recognized that exact voice, as he peeks through his tent. Time will surely tell and I’ll be strong enough to make you limp. He whispers to himself in response to the indirect taunting.\n\nHe withdraws from the negativity and begins to look through the items in his bag to organize as they’ve come jumbled from their journey towards the prison camp, a warm sensation partakes in his core as a scarf falls out of his possessions; the item reminds him of moments where things were simpler, the voices of his loved ones echoing almost audible through the very edge of his skull, he longs for such times. The sudden recollection puts a challenge to his nerves as anxiety takes over him, the rustle of the fire embers along the outdoors, as well as the subtle luminance it allows for his tent made the memories grow even more apparent, almost visible in his eyesight. Your parents burned in that fire, and you were unable to help, you’re weak and helpless and hopeless. Voices of doubt cling to his thoughts. The visibility of memories grows more and more until a depiction of skeletal remains dominates such heeding of melancholic reminiscence.\n\nAs he grows more disturbed by the fire, he begins to look for an exit as he runs away from his tent and onto the darkness of the woods. He hears laughter from the trainees outdoors that were able to see him whimpering and running towards that direction, and yet bearing that suffering is a lot more tolerable than maintaining rest in his lodgings. Darkness seeps through his perception as he finds himself amid the woods’ trees, and yet for some reason or another a voice in his head begs him to look upwards. Instead of attempting solace through the dimness of the forest, he becomes entranced by the stars above him, barely obstructed by the branches and leaves turned cerulean by the night. He holds his arm high, as if grabbing the twinkling forces above him as he whispers; ‘I swear I’ll grow strong enough.’\n\nAn opportune moment comes for his desire of strength now stationed with the heeding of responsibility allowed by his captain, as he’s placed near the walls of the prison; for the nightwatch. He perceives the other trainees as even more alerted than they were in comparison to the consecutive sparring sessions they’ve been dealt with through their training, Edmund ponders over the thought on how they’re able to preserve enough energy given their hellish overwork to maintain such poise even now at the dusk’s peak; as if he’s the only one numbing all around. Perhaps one such constant which allows for his perception of their attentive posture is the fact that they’re armed in steel, wearing their armor almost with pride; perhaps masking the tiredness they’re burdened with. Even with the safety provided by such armament, he’s quite cautious to the fact that his vision is somewhat blurred due to his helmet, the visor obstructing the fullest view of his surroundings.\n\nDespite his obstructed view, he still inspects every now and then the state of the prison’s interior given that it’s somewhat visible due to his position; as he checks the prisoners’ state ever so rhythmically within the passage of seconds. They're, after all, tasked to guard the cells which comprise the more dangerous criminals held within the kingdom. The position of the moon peaks from up above, providing luminescence almost like a ray of sunlight towards his retinas, dismantling the dilution of his pupils; he poises with hope as the stars flicker adjacent to the moon.\n\n“Stop being so stiff, Edmund.” His fellow trainee makes a remark of notice.\n\n“I can’t help it, Bok.” Ed struggles with his utterance.  “This is the first time we’re actually asked to do things, and in such a dangerous area no less.” He continues with anxiety.\n\n“Nervous that we’re guarding such dangerous people are we?” Bok replies with a question. “It doesn’t matter much, some of the soldiers stationed here are veterans, and all of us are armed, put those thoughts to rest.” He says in attempts to calm Ed’s nerves\n\n“I guess I should.” Ed replies. “It’s just that it feels so different from what we’ve done on the usual, almost surreal.” He continues, still unable to ground himself.\n\n“That’s true.” Bok replies in agreement. “After all, we’re likely to be stationed into even more dangerous areas once we’re done here.” He continues.\n\n“Exactly.” Ed takes on a humorous tone of acknowledgement, perhaps for calming. “By the way, don’t you find it difficult to actually see in this helmet, we should’ve had practice wearing actual armaments prior to our station.” He continues, finding common ground for his worries.\n\n“Couldn’t agree more, Edmund.” Edmund says. “Doesn’t help that it reeks of fish guts.” He continues with a humorous comment.\n\nAs the both of them are about to burst out laughing, sudden screams and loud noises begin to intensify originating amid the prison cells.\n\nEdmund and Bok begin to hear heavy thumping of footsteps from within the prison, with bare hesitation and without words shared; they begin to posture themselves for an upcoming skirmish. It seems that the situation is even more grave than what Edmund has anticipated, as even though his sights are untrained to the helmet’s visor; he sees an interior portion of the prison being set ablaze; as someone has started a wildfire. The yelling and screaming bounces across the heavy still set on his head; as he sees as well the spilling of blood from all directions, even the armed veterans are unable to escape such fate. Perhaps on an instinct he checks the condition of his colleagues due to the sudden violence of circumstance, and he notices most of them shaking and quivering out of fear; some frozen, and others running. It seems I’m not alone in being distraught. He finds solace on such a train of thought, as he readies to make his move the moment a prisoner collides near his proximity.\n\nHe notices some of the veteran soldiers from within the prison are able to get a grip of the situation, being able to capture some of the prisoners even amid the chaos with bare effort; but only a few; given the sheer amount of them. Some of the prisoners who are armed and aching for an exit are being killed on sight, even increasing further the puddles of blood forming on the prison interior, and now towards the outdoors. As some of the individuals of infamy begin to make their way to the exit, Edmund tackles one in attempts to capture; he utilizes the piece of rope by his waist to incapacitate his target. The moment Edmund finishes, an armed prisoner attempts to behead him; yet Bok steps in by Edmund’s left side, and in an instant stabs the prisoner by the throat as the blood gushes over the both of them. Other prisoners are seemingly ignoring the sight of sheer violence as they run past Edmund and Bok, as the situation begins to get out of control.\n\nAs the gushed blood from the prisoners and guards alike form puddles adjacent to Edmund, his hands begin to shake in sheer panic; still unable to make sense of the sudden situation.\n\n“Breathe Edmund.” Bok attempts to calm Ed. “In and out, there are prisoners we’re still supposed to capture.” He feigns toward actual responsibility, to give Ed actual objective.\n\n“What’s happening?” He questions with nervousness, with his voice heightened in modulation. “Aren’t we supposed to be in good hands?” He begins doubting.\n\n“Regardless of what happens, maintain vigilance; this is what we’ve signed up for.” Bok assures Ed.\n\n“I don’t think I’m cut out for this.” Ed gets lost in thought.\n\nBok pulls Edmund harshly.\n\n“You’re in over your head too much.” Bok exclaims. “You’ve already incapacitated one, you’re very much cut out for this.” He assures Ed of his capabilities.\n\n“But-” His whimper was interrupted.\n\n“Take notice of what’s happening around you Edmund, the clanking of steels, the stench of iron, isn’t there something within this chaos that made you want to become a soldier in the first place?” He replies attempting to ground Ed.\n\n“Yes.” Ed becomes responsive.\n\n“Then breathe, you’re not a slave to what’s happened in the past, remain here with me at present; proceed to your duties.” He encourages Ed.\n\n“Alright.” He replies with newfound strength. “Thank you for that, Bok.” He continues.\n\nAs Edmund pays heed to Bok’s encouragement, he begins to reposition beyond his station, taking steps further in attempts to capture the other prisoners. And yet, what awaits him is a face of utmost familiarity, one that fills him with unfiltered rage, but instead of becoming lost in the surge of violence; he freezes up.\n\n“U-uncle.” Ed stumbles on his words.\n\n“Edmund, what are you doing here?” His uncle responds fully inquisitive. “You’ve grown up so much, and to even become a soldier for the kingdom?” He’s seemingly shook\n\nThe both of them freeze up upon the sight of one another, unable to move. The visage and figure of his uncle comes unable to hinder sudden surges of memory of bitterness and nostalgia hitting Edmund disruptively, he has too many questions.\n\n“Why did you betray our village, uncle?” Ed replies with sheer anger “Why did you leave mom and dad to burn?” “I saw you watching our house burn to the ground, why?” He grabs his blade by its hilt, preparing for battle.\n\n“That isn’t all that happened, Edmund.” He disarms his sword. “But for now-” His uncle is interrupted, as Bok tackles him from behind.\n\n“Do you know this person, Ed?” Bok stares at Ed’s incapacitated uncle.\n\n“Yes, the very reason why I’m here.” Ed replies.\n\nThe night carries on as the other prisoners get to flee, most of them captured and some of them the subject of casualties. The night ends as a sudden encounter occurs, as Edmund grows even more inquisitive of his uncle’s remarks.\n\nEdmund visits his uncle the morning after the battle’s aftermath, the prison reeks of the stench of steel all over, as a manifestation of the ensued catastrophe pierces his nostrils. Although he isn’t stationed to wander around its interior, he uses the aftermath’s displacement of stations to finally converse; as he's filled with questions, he begins to hold the prison bars. Edmund notices the dried puddles of blood still lingering and sloppily wiped off, while he’s still somewhat disturbed by the sudden prison break. He finally locates his uncle within one of the prison cells, as his features had begun to differ from the last he saw him; with his wrinkling facial structure, darkened marks appearing on his uncle’s skin as marks of old age, with hair follicles fully coated with a pale white hue.\n\nHe begins to breathe heavily as a chance for closure is finally at his midst, and yet the surging amount of nostalgia as well as bitterness overtakes his subconscious; he begins to shiver, frozen with the amount of things he’s processing.\n\n“So you’re here, Edmund.” The uncle speaks almost gleefully.\n\n“Uncle Prown, I wouldn’t have thought I’d talk to you again and in such a sorry state.” Ed replies on a deeper tonality, almost revolted by the sight.\n\n“Yes, quite; you were still small last I saw you.” Prown comments.\n\n“Let’s cut the story short, why did you kill mom and dad?” Edmund asks on the verge of sobbing, as he grips the cell bar. “What made you betray us?” He questions with full modulation, almost screaming. “Are you also responsible for the breakout last night?”\n\n“No need to glare, Edmund.” “As far as I know, one of the guards here was conniving with a prisoner, I swear I wasn’t involved.”\n\n“You-” Edmund attempts to reply but is interrupted.\n\n“And about what happened before.” Prown continues “My line of work as a mercenary isn’t to go around and pillage nor plunder villages, I was merely framed by a noble.” He continues.\n\n“Framed?” Ed is left inquisitive, struggling in his words.\n\n“Yes, I was hired to locate some spies of the kingdom lingering within our village, they hired me to do such work as I’m familiar with the terrain.”\n\n“Then?” He asks with anger.\n\n“Then I complied. I’ve been sick of living in that poverty stricken land for years, and I’ve been promised a future for my children and myself to finally live off the rest of our lives in comfort.” Prown tells his story fully in a tone of regret. “I’d be able to get rid of a few spies lingering in the village as well.” He continues.\n\n“But things didn’t work out?”\n\n“Yes, it seems that their plan was to get rid of the village entirely, and use my men as a form of framing. “The noble I’ve struck a deal with sent soldiers to initiate the wildfire, I tried to save your parents but it seems I was a step too late.” “At the end, it seems that their objective was to eliminate the group of assassins loitered around our village; they didn’t care how many they would kill to do so.”\n\n“So that time I saw you, it wasn’t you who burnt them alive?”\n\n“You’re quite fast with the uptake.” “Though with everything aside, I’m just glad you’re alive, I’m unsure of what happened to my daughters, but at least with seeing you; I can rest easy in this cell.”\n\n“You should know better to be cautious when dealing with nobles, uncle.”\n\n“I apologize for everything Edmund, the fact that I wasn’t there for you, and the burden now residing within yourself; I’m at fault.”\n\n“I’m unsure if I believe every word you say, but I’ll be coming back to tell you the state of your daughters.”\n\n“I appreciate that, Edmund.\n\nEdmund turns his back on his uncle, attempting to halt the tears accumulating on both his eyes; as his gestures point toward the prison exit.\n\n“Wait, one more thing before you go.” “I’m proud you’ve grown up well, Ed”\n\nWithout exchanging any more looks or words, “And you’ve grown old, uncle.” He responds while crying, as he makes his way towards the outdoors.\n\nThe thoughts of vengeance gripping Edmund’s every move subsides somewhat, with his anxieties somewhat lifted, understanding the possibility that betrayal may not be the root of his family’s demise. And yet new objectives are set, surely there’s more to be done; as they exchange their farewells, he grips his outlook on the new perspective.\n\nThe stiffest feel of a surface partakes on Edmund’s back as his vision slowly enters onto waking, the training of past days met with the exhaustion of the battle nights prior makes the hard bed feel even more rigid. As he poises upwards from his laid position, his eyes affixes immediately onto the window, as the morning’s sunlight passes through the thin glass. The moment his perception greets the day’s radiance, he begins to machinate toward his usual necessities. He begins to grab his cloth aiming to rid of his blade the stench and dirt of the battle, the sword allows moments to flash before his eyes still; and yet his gaze remains unflinching in the face of such a trigger. He notices the rest of his armaments as well are almost pinkish, and intact as well of brown hue from the blood and dirt from the battle, he then paves his way to wipe each.\n\nAs he’s finished he begins to fix the contents of his bag once more, he notices a compass settled deep within the numerous items within; a keepsake of his family met with tragedy; he’s able to put it somewhere higher among the contents, no longer buried amid others. He notices the scarf gifted to him by his uncle, as he reminisces over moments of his childhood, he wears it again, recalling the times he’s always worn it as a child. He begins to hurry towards the door, as another day of training greets him.",

    "selftext": "Look, I get it. America is built different. We've got the world's largest economy, a military that dwarfs everyone else combined, constitutional checks and balances that have held for nearly 250 years, and institutions that have weathered civil war, depressions, and world wars. The dollar is still the global reserve currency. Our tech sector dominates. Our alliances span the globe. We're resilient as hell.\n\nSo yes, we'll survive these 4 years of Trump's second term. The system is strong enough to absorb a lot of damage.\n\nBut here's what keeps me up at night: Can we survive the NEXT 4 years after this?  \nBecause just look at what's happened in less than a year since January 2025:\n\nCareer civil servants purged and replaced with loyalists across federal agencies  \nJustice Department weaponized against political opponents and journalists  \nAlliances with NATO countries strained to breaking points  \nEnvironmental protections rolled back at unprecedented speed  \nPublic trust in institutions at all-time lows  \nPolitical violence becoming normalized in rhetoric  \nFederal agencies losing their independence and expertise  \nDemocratic norms treated as suggestions rather than guardrails\n\nThe problem isn't that America will collapse tomorrow. It's that we're stress-testing every single institution simultaneously. Each norm broken makes it easier to break the next one. Each precedent set becomes the new baseline.\n\nA republic, if you can keep it. That's what Franklin said. Democracies don't usually die in coups. They erode. They rust from the inside. They become hollow shells that look the same on the outside but can't actually function anymore.\n\nSo yeah, we'll make it through 2028. But what kind of country will we be handing off? What precedents will be normalized? What institutions will be too damaged to repair? What norms will be too shattered to restore?\n\nThis is your reminder that 2026 midterms matter. 2028 matters. Local elections matter. Primaries matter.\n\nWe can survive four years of almost anything. The question is whether we can survive becoming the kind of country that would choose another four years of this.\n\nVote like the republic depends on it. Because it actually might.",

Two boys had pinned a man down and were slapping him repeatedly, shouting that he “touched a girl inappropriately.” The strange part was that the girl herself wasn’t saying anything or complaining — she was just standing nearby.\n\nI stepped closer (but not into the fight) and said they should stop hitting him and hand him over to metro security instead. While all this was happening, the man they were slapping managed to slip away. The two boys immediately started blaming me, saying things like “people like you are the reason girls aren’t safe in Delhi” and “what if this happened to someone in your family?”\n\nA few minutes later the man they had slapped came back and shell shocked the guy who slapped him , which turned into a fight. I ran to get metro authorities. CISF arrived quickly, separated everyone, and took them inside to talk.\n\nNow I’m wondering — was I wrong to tell them to stop hitting him? I wasn’t defending him, just trying to avoid mob violence and let authorities handle it. But the way they blamed me left me second-guessing myself.\n\nWould appreciate honest opinions. Should I have stayed out of it? Or was getting the authorities involved the right thing to do?",

    "selftext": "It’s funny? ironic? to me that the two writers who are not interested in moralistic instructional stories have attracted an audience that is seemingly only interested in that.\n\nI know that a lot of it is due to how society is today. However maybe the writers thought that their story which doesn’t care about good and evil wouldn’t interest that kind of audience.\n\nNeither  version of IWTV cares about who is good and who is evil. Though the characters do struggle with the fact that they are evil, the story never punishes them for being bad or evil.\n\nThe story much like life dishes out trauma to everyone.\n\nWhile the audience is more interested in ranking the vampires from most to least evil, Rice and Rolin don’t.\n\nTo me Rice and Rolin want to examine each character through the lens of trauma. Rice seemed concerned with finding a standard of life outside of traditional values and religious morals. Rolin seems to want to showcase a love story that survives monstrosity. \n\nI don’t know how compatible these stories are with the audience they attracted. \n\nTo me it seems like a powder keg waiting to blow. \n\nIt’s not lost on me that the story that’s being told on tv could not be told until now. However because of how moralistic and puritanical society is lately it will undoubtedly cause backlash still.\n\nTL:DR: What are the odds of a story filled with violence, abuse, coercion, trauma and incest has attracted an audience that expects the story to provide moralistic instructions when the writers themselves rejected that.",

Dans la France de Macron je dis pas non.) Je suis consciente qu'on a tous un emploi du temps plus ou moins chargé, je ne me suis pas vraiment inquiétée du temps qui s'écoulait au départ. Mais là, en checkant la page du vendeur et nos échanges pour voir s'il y avait une quelconque avancée.. comment dire 😅 Le vendeur a republié des annonces avec les mêmes figurines qu'il m'a vendu. La première, il y a cind jour. La deuxième, il y a 2 heures. Même photos, même prix de base, même description. \n\nUne part de moi essaye de me rassurer en me disant qu'il a plusieurs modèles de la même figurine, que c'est un vendeur honnête avec 217 évaluations quasi-parfaites. Une autre part de moi trouve ça louche.. ma commande toujours pas expédiée et le reupload des mêmes figurines, j'ai comme l'impression que je vais me faire entuber. \n\nJe n'ose pas contacter le vendeur par peur de paraître comme une Karen même si j'imagine que je dois me faire violence 🥲 Bref, j'espère que vous pourrez me rassurer (ou non 😬) sur la marche à suivre.

    "title": "Cherry50 since yesterday!",
    "selftext": "I got it! I cherried all 50 of the games on my Nintendo Switch! (Switch 2, just to brag)\n\nOh, heavens, what a journey! I'm so proud I gave this game a try. Now is the time to let go of it. And what better way to than to post about it online!\n\nI used guides, but I usually started playing the games without any guides. Especially if it's a rather tedious game or if I get stuck, I refer to guides, cause life is too short.\n\nRecap time! Of course, my personal opinion is supreme. Got a problem with that? Then go read another post. Or fight me in the comment section, I'll play fair, promise! 🫂\n\n\\~ \\* \\~\n\nHere is my experience with the games:\n\n**Barbuta:** Instant turn-off. I know, \"Barbuta is genious\", \"I love how they started Ufo50 with this game\", bla bla blargh, NO! Barbuta is no fun. And no, ancient video games were no fun. And yes, it was smart of Mossmouth to have this be the first game, but **BARBUTA. IS. NOT. FUN.** I used a guide, tried exactly one run per day until I got it cherries and never booted it up again. Except to show it to my friends, who reacted just like I did and turned it off.\n\n**Bug Hunter:** Eugh... I wasn't a fan of it first, but it grew on me. I must say though, getting cherry here was tough. I was proud once I got the cherry.\n\n**Ninpek:** I love it. Sadly, my friends don't. Memorable music. I like arcade-ish games.\n\n**Paint Chase:** It was... OK. I got a cherry here pretty quickly.\n\n**Magic Garden:** Yes, it's a good game. But a short one at that.\n\n**Mortol:** Oh shoot! A game with a lot of depth. Great game, but it was hard! Guide helped here a ton. Played it a bit with friends. Great music! (Side note: Nintendo Switch version is bugged regarding new game. Mortol II has a different bug: The large red knights have infinite range with their sword swing.)\n\n**Velgress:** Here we go! Time to climb up! Doodle Jump Time! Except in better. Definitely a fun game! If your friends don't have skill issues, take turns playing that game. I caught myself playing it long time after my cherry run and cherried it again and again and again and again and again...\n\n**Planet Zoldath:** Err... I remember that game vaguely. I was glad once I got my cherry. It was tedious.\n\n**Attactics:** One of the first games I played for a longer time. It had some frustrating sections, but it was fun! Like the music a lot.\n\n**Devilition:** This game... apparently I suck at it, but I don't quite dislike it. I don't even know why I'm bad at it. I just suck. It took me a lot of energy to cherry it. I was glad once it ended.\n\n**Kick Club:** No. The theme is just not my thing. I'm not too keen on soccer. And the combo mechanic is too cryptic, I still have no idea when a combo counts! Skip.\n\n**Avianos:** It took me a long time to discover, that I didn't get the garden present on this game! It's fun, I wish it was kinda bigger, tbh. Such a great fantasy though! Avianos XL please!\n\n**Mooncat:** I know, everybody loves mooncat, I'm just alright with it. It's cute. Prefer this of the triology any day over Barbuta. Nice soundtrack.\n\n**Bushido Ball:** Ooof. Mid.\n\n**Block Koala:** Not great at first, but grew on me, once I got the hang of it. I used a guide less often than I thought! Cute as hell! I never really used the editor though...\n\n**Camouflage:** Needs more depth! Great game! If you want to have a good cry, here is more lore: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LZ2K44LIxM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LZ2K44LIxM)\n\n**Campanella:** At first, I didn't like it a lot. But damn, this game! I wish it was there with me in my childhood. Love the music here!\n\n**Golfaria:** The last cherry I got, which was yesterday. With good reason. This game is not my cup of tee. (wink, wink) I followed a misleading guide, which made my run much worse and infuriating. It really took me a long time (49 cherries) to even touch this. Eugh...! Gross.\n\n**The Big Bell Race:** If I remember it correctly, I got my first cherry here on accident. I just played it the first time, got the first place, cherry. That was a huge motivation boost. Wish my friends would try this out with me.\n\n**Warptank:** Apart from the REALLY confusing hub world, fun concept, until it got tedious. Such a drag to cherry...\n\n**Waldorf's Journey:** Another emo game like Camouflage. I had my fun with this. Give a walrus a hug!\n\n**Porgy:** Porgy is just... well, it overstays its welcome. The mechanics are fun, the bosses were reeeeeeaaaaaally looooong and getting the cherry took me some time. I think some underground checkpoints would have been nice, but just like this... nah. Another cutesy game though, at core.\n\n**Onion Delievery:** Rage game. I liked it after I got the hang of it, but it was a pain. You can't weasel your way out of this, just train a lot! Banger music! I love how aquaplaning is basically the final boss without any music, because having a car crash in real life is just pure horror. Gotta appreciate the thoughts they put behind a lot of games.\n\n**Caramel Caramel:** Needed a guide to cherry. Wasn't that bad, but a bit confusing in the beginning. I used to play Touhou on normal, so... yeah.\n\n**Party House:** We need Party House XL. Where is the mobile version of it?! I got really addicted to that game, but it has elements of rage in it, especially the infamous triple-rowdy-in-the-beginning-combo. I wonder how people get those unbelievable 100 victory streaks.\n\n**Hot Foot:** The humour it has! Child violence is so goddamn funny! And so is this game. If you think, the controls are confusing, then what about Mooncat?!?! I mean, yes, the controls are difficult, but they aren't if you grab a friend. Huge replayability. Thanks, Mossmouth! Hot Foot XL please.\n\n**Divers:** Better than Barbuta, worse than Mooncat. Glad it's over.\n\n**Rail Heist:** At first, I didn't dig it. Then I got the hang of it and booooooy! Mossmouth's take on Team17's Worms really plays great! My friends loved this game on a unreasonable degree, so I spent a lot of time with it. Great music! We need Rail Heist XL.\n\n**Vainger:** Getting a cherry took me some time, but Theta Sector music made up for it. Final boss was also a bit too long for my test. I will forever remember the cutscene at the cherry ending, where we see &gt;!the protagonist shedding a tear.!&lt; Great game!\n\n**Rock On! Island:** I played it without a guide first. **I WAS NOT AWARE YOU COULD UPGRADE YOUR OWN WEAPONS FOR A LONG TIME!** Jesus! Fun, but I was glad I got the cherry. The last level really sucks.\n\n**Pingolf:** You'd think, since I hated Golfaria and dislike golf in general, I'd dislike this game, but no. It ticks the arcade-ish box and you can control the ball after launching it, so it's okay. Good times... Some stages did give me a headache though.\n\n**Mortol II:** No, just no. Music got a downgrade, your goal is very unclear without a guide, this game is just too cryptic for its own good. Had a guide give me directions and I was glad it was over. And I swear, that fucking giant red knight's sword swing bug, that has unlimited reach...\n\n**Fist Hell:** Errr.... Could this game be a bit better balanced? And a lot less mean? It kinds needs a bit more depth. I liked the theme, but it is tough. I always died on the third stage and then I just had a run, where I got past the &gt;!aliens!&lt; and cherried it. I never used continues, I'm like \"either I quit once I get game over or I make it without continues\". \n\n**Overbold:** Huh. Difficult. Didn't take me too long to cherry it, but it wasn't easy. It was alright. For some reason I think I should like this game more than I do...\n\n**Campanella 2:** Another guide heavy game. It could be a bit more lenient on your fuel, but it's definitely doable. Why the hell make autogenerated map and then give the player not a lot of fuel?! Eugh. Glad it ended. Great esacpe theme though! Above average game.\n\n**Hyper Contender:** It's weird. It just is. Average game.\n\n**Valbrace:** This was my 49th cherry. Why? Cause I'm not exploring all that dungeon shit without a guide. And I'm not going to memorize all spells without a guide. Tedious fighting. Every game over really did hurt and I hate replaying all of the shit I already know. This game needs a remake that is a bit more user friendly and we're good to go!\n\n**Rakshasa:** Great game, but also slightly cryptic! Overly long stages and a lot of nail biting at the end. I had fun!\n\n**Star Waspir:** I mean, I played Touhou. But the key difference between Touhou and Star Waspir: The background in Star Waspir is nauseating unlike in Touhou and (with very few exceptions in some Touhou games) collecting a power up in Touhou is **NEARLY NEVER BAD.** This stupid \"EGG\" mechanic is horrible, stage 3 is really humbling for NO REASON whatsoever and... no, let's just continue, everybody knows this game. \n\n**Grimstone:** I like the action input whenever you're attacking. Love the battle music! But another tedious game... Yuck.\n\n**Lords of Diskonia:** Late cherry. I enjoyed it a bit more once I got into it, but... man! Pure rage game later, since the computer player will rarely miss or f up.\n\n**Night Manor:** I read somewhere, that this might be the best horror point and click. And I think, I can agree. Used a guide of course, but a guide can't protect me from the heart attacks I got. Love this game!\n\n**Elfazar's Hat:** Pocky and Rocky in bad. Same issue here with Star Waspir: You have to think when picking up power-ups and they vanish way too quickly. Also, lol: that hidden bonus level. I got the cherry first, I discovered then (through a guide) that there are magic tickets. I like the music and victory jingle a lot! Average game.\n\n**Pilot Quest:** Once I figured out it's half idle game, it was fun. Another waaaay too cryptic game. I know, Mossmouth did that on purpose, but... COME ON! Best music ever though at the crash site.\n\n**Mini &amp; Max:** This game should have been in my childhood. But it wasn't, so I just used a guide. Another game, that grew on me the more I played it. The story is sooooo cute! Also, that mechnical boss has such a great music. This game makes me feel nostalgic.\n\n**Combatants:** I prefer this over Golfaria, Barbuta, Divers and what not. But Combatants isn't fun nor in any way memorable. Skip!\n\n**Quibble Race:** I got the cherry by accident on my second or third playthrough. I was very surprised when that happened. Love the vibe, nice music, the game itself isn't that interesting though.\n\n**Seaside Drive:** My friends got me gold when I was lending them my Nintendo Switch 2 for a day, I got the cherry with them later them. I think I should try this game out more. For some reason, it doesn't really tickle me though.\n\n**Campanella 3:** At first, I didn't like this game. After getting a cherry on Campanella 1 and 2 though, I... still didn't like this game. It's alright, but it's also a bit too strict with the bonus level and live mechanics, as far as I remember. Average game. Glad I got the cherry and farewell, Queen Zu.\n\n**Cyber Owls:** Description said, this game rushed. I can tell. Love the theme, music is good, but **WHY DOES GUIN ONLY HAVE TWO HP?!?!?!?** This game is the definition of unsatifactory. Remake this game, but make it good. \n\n\\~ \\* \\~\n\nI'm happy to read your thoughts on my thoughts! And I'm proud I cherried all of UFO50. \n\nThanks Mossmouth for that wonderful experience of having a second gaming childhood. ❤️",

The way he describes it he makes it look like humans literally biologically evolved to be incapable to work for money/resources or inflict any kind of violence except for self-defense.\n\n  \nIf that was the case Yar's planet Turkana IV wouldn't have collapsed into failed state with roving rape gangs, and widespread drug problems to escape poverty and pain. They literally wouldn't have been able to rape or murder each other and suffer from poverty, because they don't have that biologicaly programming to do it.\n\n  \nHe says humans don't work for money anymore and want to better themselves, but he obviously comes from a family of old money and lives in a chateau on his family's winery. That's like a weathly person telling everyone else struggling that money doesn't bring happiness.\n\n  \nHe even once was **literally** called out on his bullshit once:\n\n\n\n&gt;[Captain Jean-Luc Picard](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001772/?ref_=ttch_qu): In my century, we don't succumb to revenge.

    "title": "Subreddit Rules Updates/Feedback",
    "selftext": "Hey all.\n\nI have been reviewing the mod queues and reports that we got over the last several months, and have updated the rules, removal reasons and auto-moderator settings, but I wanted to make a post announcing the changes as well, so you guys can both see these updates, as well as provide some feedback on rules (or their relaxations) that you'd like to see.\n\n**Low Effort Posts -** This is the big offender and the new removal reason that we are using as a catch-all umbrella for the following types of posts, as well as our reasons for why:\n\nQuestions\n\nReddit is a forum, designed for discussion amongst users; it is not a search engine.  By this I mean if you're posting questions here, we ask that you post discussion-based, non-personal questions that can be used by other users in the future.\n\nWhat does that mean?  It means if you're looking for a specific nugget of information and just need an answer, you're better off using Google.  However if you're looking for insight and opinion from other users, this is the place.  Here are some examples:\n\n* Bad:\n\n&gt;Is the MS16 good?\n\n* Good:\n\n&gt;I've been struggling to find a setup for the MS16 that work for me.  I've tried it as a sniper, but the scopes don't have the zoom I want.  I've tried it as an assault rifle but it doesn't have the rate of fire to make it competitive.  Any suggestions for how to build it and add it to my loadout?\n\n* Bad:\n\n&gt;I can't find the last Izlia mask \\[insert blurry, sideways cellphone picture of TV\\]\n\n* Good:\n\n&gt;I'm trying to 100% Far Cry Primal and cant find the last Izlia mask. Anyone know of a resource link that shows me where all the masks are and how to get to them?\n\nQuestions that drive discussion and serve as a resource for future redditors are welcome here.  Yes/no questions or personal questions that won't help anyone else down the road are better asked to a search engine, and will most likely be removed as a low-effort post.\n\nReferences\n\nAnother big one.  To be blunt, just because something reminded you of Far Cry, doesn't make it a good post.  We get a lot of \"guy base jumping in a wing suit\" or \"saw a white church\" or \"saw the word Yes\" or any similar post that reminded someone of Far Cry but really have nothing to do with the games and are treading more into the realm of engagement farming. These will fall under the low-effort posting rule.\n\nAI posts\n\nAI posts have sucked before and they will continue to suck, forever.  This includes AI art, as well as *\"I asked AI to rank the Far Cry games and it said...\"* or any similar post.  Reddit is a place for **people** to communicate with one another, not to show off a picture that a language-learning model drew for you.  AI posts will be removed as low-effort.\n\nWanton Violence\n\nAnnoying I have to mention this one, but there's been a spike in these.  If your post is just you killing civilians, or pictures of dead NPCs, or videos of you abusing an NPC corpse, your post will be removed.  Whatever you do in your own play through of Far Cry games is your business, but sharing a video of you shooting into a crowd or hitting the corpses of the Twins from New Dawn with a shovel for five minutes is really weird, and not welcome here.\n\n**Questions to the Community**\n\nFor a while, we asked that memes not be posted here, because by their very nature, memes beget memes beget memes, and soon the subreddit is looking like a dumpy Facebook meme page.  There is a r/FarCryMemes subreddit that memes were redirected to, however that subreddit is rather dead and we are are in a bit of a dry spell here on the official page.\n\nRather than just open this subreddit to memes, I figured I would ask the community what you guys would prefer:\n\n* Keep the 'No Memes' rule.\n* Relax the rule a bit to allow *some* memes\n\nLow-effort 'template memes' would still be removed, but if people wanted to create their own memes and put in some effort, we would be open to allowing them here on r/FarCry for the time being, until there's some franchise news and we have something else to talk about on here.\n\nTo be perfectly transparent, the mod team is still leaning 'no' on the memes thing, but rather than making the decision for the whole of the community, we figured we'd at least take the temperature of what you guys would like to see.  It's everyone's subreddit, so we should at least ask for input on the rules.\n\n**If you have any feedback on these rule changes or anything else you'd like to discuss regarding the existing rules, please do so below!**\n\nThanks!",

Despite the fact that he performed wonders and miracles as king and worked so much just to improve Elbaph. With just ONE powerful move \"If\" only he had chosen a different route and I do wonder.. A \"what if\" scenario in this case #1167\n\n----------\nI am very aware that everything doesn't need to resolve in violence and as kindness goes, \"sometimes your kindness needs boundaries.\"\n\nThere's nothing wrong with wanting to change the system. Especially when you have the passion, guidance, persistence, integrity, and confidence. But Harald should balance out the motives. Towards himself and around himself because \"Love without boundaries invites manipulation.\"\n\nIda is such a goat in the family's perspective due to the fact of her OWN sheer strength, endurance, peace, comfort, and love despite what's going on around her AND to her. The things that don't need to happen and yet again, she is still smiling through all this. The growth of everything is what made her ONE of the strongest mother's in One Piece (W Ida)\n\nLoki suffered in different layers, while also enduring the starvation of wanting to be loved and he STILL came out on top. His story is what makes Loki so beautiful, \"your past is the keeper of your future.\" We already know Loki's future, but that doesn't change the fact that he is still ONE of badass character in One Piece! (W Loki)\n\n---------\nLoki's birth giver, dysfunctional and abusive family/descendants/lineage are the true defintion of \"Manipulators are addicted to drama.\"",

I’d like to gain experience and become a healthcare data analyst eventually. \n\nMy question is how does one do it? I’m reading both this reddit and the healthIT reddit and am seeing people say the two are different but then I see so many identical things in the two. \n\nWhat kind of entry level roles would I pursue to gain experience to become a health data analyst or would the analyst role itself be the entry level role? \n\nI understand that having a CHDA is not technically required but is it important enough for job prospects to pursue anyways? Since my neuroscience program is not a CAHIM accredited program should I pursue an accredited masters in HI to get an RHIA or RHIT and then work towards getting a CHDA? I understand that I need plenty of experience in SQL as well as Power BI and Tableau. I also have plenty of experience in programming + clinical shadowing since I was formerly premed.\n\nI should add that I don’t have much relevant work experience outside of working in a couple stores and working at an afterschool center teaching programming to middle and high schoolers.\n\nIt just seems like there’s so much conflicting information so I’m a bit lost, the current job market and threat of AI + outsourcing doesn’t help the stress either lol\n",

    "selftext": "Now supposedly Westalis and  Ostania are meant to represent East and West Germany and in Germany's version of Thanksgiving is called *Erntedankfest (Harvest Thanks Festival)* and its a a lot the same but also slightly different Thanksgiving is celebrated int he USA. According to wiki there are a few religious elements to it as well as the secular ones. But since no one in spyxfamily is religious I am just going to stick with secular parts\n\nLoid thought it would just be him, Anya, Yor, and Bond. But Then Anya asks about Uncle Scruffy and Loid responds that \"Of course Franky can come\". Then Yor remarks that she and Yuri always celebrate together and asks what time she should tell him to come over by. Loid groans inwardly, but he cannot exactly tell Yor not to invite Yuri so he gives her a time. Yor comes back from talking to Yuri on the phone and excitedly tells Loid and Anya that Yuri is apparently good friends with a girl, who has no family to celebrate with, so she invited them both. Loid asks the girls name and then groans outwardly because he remembers Chloe being the name of another SSS member.\n\nLater at the hospital Nightfall's makes some offhanded comment about getting into the holiday spirit and Loid tells her about the people who will be showing up at his house expecting to food and to \"hang out\". Nightfall seizes the opportunity to suggest that it sounds like he could use some backup dealing with the SSS agents and the food. Nightfall is actually a pretty good cook. Loid relents and gives her an invite.\n\nAnya goes to school with the idea that her family is having a party, and that that means she can invite Becky to play, and Damian so she can further plan B. Asking Damian goes very badly, he already has plans and when Anya tries to convince him to change them they get into a all out shouting match, and he is not coming. Becky says that her and Martha will stop by, and Martha will probably want them to bring a desert out of politeness. Anya tells her to bring a cake with Peanuts.\n\nThe big day comes. Loid cooks a big meal then holds up in the kitchen, only venturing out as much as politeness dictates he must. Eventually Anya and Franky get him to stay out more though\n\nYor was not allowed to help cook, so she is trying to make up for that by serving everyone and putting a lot of effort into playing hostess. Yuri and Chloe arrive first, bringing some flowers. Yuri see's Yor rushing about and immediately starts helping her, while making several comments about how rude Loid is being by making Yor do all the hosting. He also does not like when Franky \"makes eyes at\" Yor or Chloe (a.k.a looks at them for longer than 5 seconds at one time), and is thinking he will arrest Franky if he does not stop. He does not care if Franky wants to do it to Loidy's nurse friend Fiona though.\n\nNightfall as Fiona brought over multiple pre-cooked dishes. She alternates between praising Loid's food, mentioning extra steps she took with her food (*This is her trying to intimidate Yor, letting her know that she is talented in an area Yor isn't)*  and making curious small talk with Chloe *(twilight told Fiona to asses what level info source/threat Chloe is, believing she would be more open to converse with another women*) and Franky.\n\nFranky came in said \"hey\" to Bond, gave Anya new toy and asked her how school is going. He then plants himself in between Fiona and Chloe and trys to impress them both by bragging about new inventions of his. Fiona is somewhat impressed and is trying to send Franky that she will check out his inventions next time she visits him for assistance, for now though he needs to leave both her and Chloe alone. Chloe finds Franky kinda creepy, demands to know why he would even invent all these crazy things, and catches Yuri's eyes when Franky tells her its \" *just a hobby'* and he is just *\"a simple artist and man of wonder\".* Anya goes to get Loid who suddenly really needs Franky.\n\nMartha and Becky arrive last, and they do bring bring peanut butter cakes. Becky says \"Hello\" to Yor, embarrass Loid by flirting with him, then she and Anya decide to style Bond's fur or something. Martha offers to help Yor and Yuri serve people, but directed to relax instead and settles into a comfy arm chair. She remarks how nice it is to be surrounded by good food and good folks, and she can remember times holidays past were people struggled to provide or had to celebrate in secret. Surprisingly listening to Martha's stories gets all the adults to shut up and get along for a bit.\n\nWhen School resumes Anya and Becky get into another argument with Damian, Ewen, and Emile over who had the better holiday. Left over treats are shared by both sides.",

    "title": "Monad Web Wallet: Empowering Users With Secure and Seamless Web3 Asset Management",
    "selftext": "The rapid growth of blockchain technology has transformed how individuals interact with digital assets, and web-based wallets have become essential tools in this new digital economy. **Monad Web Wallet** stands out as an advanced, browser-accessible platform designed to give users full control over their cryptocurrencies without sacrificing convenience or security. Unlike traditional software wallets that require installation, the Monad Web Wallet operates directly through the web, making it accessible from any modern device with an internet connection. This accessibility is a major advantage for users who want a fast, flexible, and secure way to manage their digital assets, interact with decentralized applications, and maintain total ownership of their funds. As blockchain adoption continues to rise, the Monad Web Wallet offers a robust gateway into the expanding world of decentralized finance.\n\nSecurity is the foundation upon which the [**Monad Web Wallet**](https://monmonad.com) is built. In a digital environment where cyber threats, phishing attacks, and malicious extensions are persistent dangers, safeguarding user funds requires more than basic protection. Monad Web Wallet addresses this need with a multi-layered security system that includes advanced encryption, secure key generation, and non-custodial asset management. Users retain full control of their private keys, ensuring that no third party—including the wallet provider—can access their funds. This model significantly reduces the vulnerabilities associated with centralized platforms. Additionally, browser-based isolation, anti-phishing alerts, and optional multi-factor authentication offer additional security features. These layers work together to provide a safe and trustworthy environment where users can confidently store and manage digital currencies without worrying about unauthorized access or data breaches.\n\nOne of the primary strengths of the Monad Web Wallet is its ease of use. Traditional crypto wallets often intimidate beginners with technical terminology, complicated setup procedures, and confusing user interfaces.

Upon logging in, users can easily view their balances, monitor transaction history, and manage multiple tokens across supported networks. The wallet’s user-friendly interface makes essential actions—such as sending or receiving funds—straightforward with simple forms and QR-code scanning. Multi-chain support enables users to hold and manage assets from different blockchain networks in one place. Whether someone is a first-time crypto user or a seasoned Web3 participant, the Monad Web Wallet offers a smooth, comfortable experience.\n\nAnother vital advantage of the Monad Web Wallet is its strong compatibility with decentralized applications. As Web3 ecosystems evolve, users are no longer satisfied with simple storage solutions—they expect integrated platforms that allow them to engage with decentralized exchanges (DEXs), NFT marketplaces, staking protocols, GameFi platforms, and more. Monad Web Wallet includes built-in dApp connectivity, enabling users to access various services without switching apps or installing external extensions. Its fast transaction processing, customizable network fees, and secure smart contract interactions enable users to explore DeFi opportunities with confidence. This compatibility transforms the Monad Web Wallet into a versatile tool for maximizing the benefits of decentralized technology. From swapping tokens and minting NFTs to participating in liquidity pools, the wallet ensures that users can easily connect to the growing digital ecosystem.\n\nLooking ahead, **Monad Web Wallet is well-positioned to become a leading gateway into the decentralized future**. As blockchain technology expands into everyday applications—such as payments, digital identity, tokenized assets, and decentralized social platforms—the need for versatile, secure, and accessible web wallets will only intensify. The development roadmap for Monad Web Wallet includes upcoming features such as enhanced cross-chain capabilities, improved privacy options, integrated analytics tools, and smoother dApp discovery experiences. With its forward-thinking design, the wallet aims to empower users with more transparency, better control, and expanded financial possibilities. In an era where individuals increasingly seek financial independence and digital ownership, Monad Web Wallet stands out as a trusted companion for exploring and participating in the Web3 world. It is more than just a digital wallet—it is a powerful bridge connecting users to the future of decentralized finance.",

So this is old, but I got inspired by a song that was on my Spotify Wrapped last year. “I only wanna be with you” by the Bay City Rollers. So I figured I’d draw my OC with her friends from Outset Island, none other than Link and Aryll! This is a picture they took at one point on the lookout tower on their island!\n\nThey became friends because they lived on the same tiny island which was home to only a few other families, and they made a name for themselves as the ALO Outset Trio.\n\nThey would spend ALL DAY outside together! From the crack of dawn to pitch black.\n\nThey had an AWESOME life. Yes, it was Octavia who convinced Aryll to just let Link borrow her telescope, not keep it!\n\nHowever, after Aryll was kidnapped by the Helmaroc King, this obviously prompted Link’s entire quest, but Octavia came along and acted as a companion before she became a sage. She was the last one out of the three to be awakened.\n\nYeah, keep in mind. The Helmaroc King was looking for pointy eared girls under Ganondorf’s orders to find Zelda. Octavia was a pointy eared girl of Hylian heritage! So even stepping FOOT into Ganondorf and the Helmaroc King’s base..she was basically walking into a trap which could either result in her being thrown into the cell with Aryll, Mila, and Maggie.. or worse:\n\nIf Ganondorf found out or even sensed that she was a sage with dormant memories, and held one of the three instruments, he would see her as an actual threat to his plans and his life, so he’d absolutely kill her without hesitation.\n\nThis would result in the Master Sword’s restoration not completely full, as there would be no one in her bloodline to take her place, as she was the last living member in her family. So she didn’t know this about her obviously! \n\nThis was just a secret within her that she hadn’t found out yet! She didn’t see that instrument of hers as sacred, she just saw it as playing an instrument merely as a fun little hobby, not knowing she was preparing for something huge.",

    "selftext": "Spoiler for book 10. \n\nIm close to the end of book 10. I just finished the chapter where Jason makes the pact with Death to help get rid of the undead. I felt myself getting unreasonably upset at the terms of the pact. Its so one sided its not even funny. She (Death) took away Jason's ability to resurrect forever!! The man is constantly saving the world and going up against threats that outclass him and she wants to take away the one ability that could keep him in the fight. \n\nTaking his two current revives should've been enough especially since killing the undead is something the god should be helping with. But I get it, Death wants things to stay dead. I just felt the pact was unfair. \n\nAlso, what happens when he reaches diamond rank now? We know he can become immortal with the Astral King stuff, but cant diamond rankers still die in battle? And when they do, dont they revive themselves? Would Jason be unable to do that? Or would the he be unable to be killed if he fully becomes transcendent? \n\nIm going to keep reading but I literally had to stop for a bit because the Goddess pissed me off with those terms. Also, he has to be respectful to gods now?? That just seems like the gods being petty about Jason's attitude. ",

    "selftext": "2025 has absolutely not been my year. It started beautifully. In the first days of January, I met a man who, deep down, I knew was not the right fit for me. But he looked amazing on paper: an accomplished entrepreneur, a university professor, a military volunteer, stoic, serious about commitment (but also on paper only, he was absolutely not into investing any emotional labor into a relationship). The problem was that all of this existed only on paper and not in the emotional reality of the relationship.\n\nVery quickly I noticed I was losing myself. I was constantly walking on eggshells. There was no lightness or fun because he took everything so seriously. We rarely did anything enjoyable together except have great intellectual conversations. Sex was not great and kept getting worse. Worst of all, I could not be open with him about my feelings and needs. Whenever I tried, no matter how carefully, he responded by questioning our compatibility. Every need or request I expressed felt like an attack to him. Instead of wanting to work things out together, he played the compatibility card as a threat.\n\nIt was not an outwardly dramatic relationship, but internally it damaged me deeply. It exhausted my nervous system and brought back overwhelming anxiety. I ended the relationship in mid-October and we parted ways.\n\nThen there was work. The year also started well, but I work in software engineering and like many companies this year, mine got acquired and the new owners decided to restructure and lay off many employees. I was laid off at the end of September. As a manager, I had already watched some of our best employees being dismissed months earlier, which only increased my anxiety. From February to July, everything was uncertain. I did not know whether I would keep my position, who else might be affected, or whether my team members would also lose their jobs. Those months of uncertainty were brutal. In July I finally learned that I would be fired, and my last working day was at the end of September, just a few weeks before the breakup.\n\nSince then, I have been applying for new roles, but mostly I have been rejected or ghosted. With 15 years of experience, some companies consider me overqualified, while others simply have hundreds of candidates. I have not lost hope, but it is painful.\n\nSo I lost my job that I liked and I lost my relationship. And on top of that, I am an expat. I have lived in this country for over 5 years, but now I am questioning my future here. I have been thinking about returning to my home country, but I no longer truly feel at home there either. I would have to rebuild my life from scratch. I miss some things about home and I want to be closer to my aging parents, but socially I have very few people left there. I have drifted apart from childhood friends and many others. My home country can also be quite unforgiving to people in their 40s who want to build new connections, especially romantic ones.\n\nIn my current country, I have many acquaintances as an expat, but these connections often lack depth. I feel torn between these two places, which is also giving me a good amount of anxiety.\n\nThen there are my parents, whose health issues worry me every day. And my sister was recently diagnosed with bipolar disorder. Every day is a struggle for her, and although I do not see it in person, I hear about it every day.\n\nLately, I have been feeling like this year, 2025, has shattered me into pieces. I am 40. I want a loving family of my own. I ended a relationship with someone who was not right for me, and I am still grieving and trying to let him go. I am also grieving the loss of my job. I'm worried about my parents and my sister. I know I am physically healthy and that this phase will eventually pass, but right now the pain feels unbearable and I am losing hope.\n\nI wanted both things: a long-term relationship that would blossom into a family and a stable job that would give me some sense of security. This year I realized that both my relationship and my career at that company had no future, and I am still grieving both. There are days, like today, when I feel numb, flat, sad, and hopeless. The job market makes everything harder, and my age makes relationships feel more challenging.\n\nI am sure many of you have gone through difficult periods in your life. Please share your experiences.  \n**How do you keep hope alive when life knocks you down?**  \nWhat helped you move forward, stay grounded, and eventually see light again?\n\nAny personal story, any encouragement, any spark of brightness would mean a lot to me.",

    "selftext": "**TL;DR:**  \nMy parents constantly have toxic fights and keep dragging me into them, blaming me or making me choose sides. My mom says she’d leave my dad if it wasn’t for me, and my dad asks if I hate him. My mom has also made suicide attempts. Today I accidentally saw a dating app notification on my mom’s phone (she hates cheaters) which broke my trust in her and made me feel like everything I believed is collapsing. Now I’m scared I’ll never be able to trust people.\n\n\n\n  \nThe environment of my house sickens me because of how often my parents fight (its not a normal fight, they swear/at each other, give s\\*icide threats, drag me into their fights, threat to call cops on each other)    \n  \nNo matter how much I try to cope up, or distract myself they drag me into their fights asking \"aren't I right?/tell me who's right in between us?\"   \n  \nmy mum says If it weren't you I would have left this man so early, its you who's stopping me\" (I swear to god at that moment I question my existence, why am I here, why do I burden her?)\n\nmy father says \"am I that awful of a father? do you hate me that much?\" (he says that because I take my mom's side for her to not give s\\*icide threats, or even try to commit, she has tried committing s\\*icide multiple times)  \n  \nToday I took my mother's phone for some work, she told me to, and I saw something that I never imagined I would've seen, there was a notification from a dating app. I kept phone down immediately, thought to myself this can't be true. My mother is a good person, she used to have faith yet I don't know how could she do this.  \n  \n(me and my mother are close, and i'm the only person she trusts, once when we were talking she said she hates people who cheat, she looks down on them.)   \n  \nMy mother told me to finish the work I left off her phone, and I saw that notification again, it broke my trust, it made everything I believed in had fallen apart. I can't confront her. seeing all of this makes me think if I could even trust someone again or could I even be with someone, my parents have made me fear for anything, any sort of relationship. I don't know how will I deal with this.",

On your way home, alone in a district whispered to be dangerous, you’re intercepted by the Captain of the Knight Guard, who mistakes you for a criminal looking for prey. One tug of your hood and one breath of your scent later, you go from “suspect” to “everything” in the world. You are fated partners.\n\n**SCRIPT**\n\n**\\[City Streets — Outer District\\] \\[Near Midnight\\]** \n\n**\\[Distant tavern noise, then muffled as a door closes\\] \\[Listener’s footsteps on stone\\]**\n\n**\\[Captain of the Knight Guard To Themself — Observes from nearby\\]** — *Quiet, low, focused*  \nThere. Got one… slipping out of the tavern like a shadow.\n\n**\\[Heavier Captain’s footsteps — Follows the Listener at a distance\\]**\n\n**\\[To Themself\\]** — *Controlled, vigilant*  \nMoving fast. Head down. Avoiding every pool of light. Too careful for a drunk, too graceful for a thief. Let’s see which you are, stranger.\n\n**\\[To Listener — Closes the distance, grabs and pins the Listener to the wall\\]** — *Low, rough, satisfied*  \nGot you.\n\n**\\[Listener gasps, tries to pull back slightly\\]**\n\n**\\[Close, grip unyielding\\]** — *Firm, cold*  \nWell ? What exactly are you doing, skulking through the streets at this hour ? Hunting for someone to rob ? Or perhaps… looking for easier prey ? Kidnapping, maybe ?\n\n**\\[Listener shakes their head quickly in protest\\]**\n\n— *Commanding, skeptical*  \nNo ? You expect me to believe that ?\n\n**\\[Leans in\\]** — *Stern*  \nYou picked the wrong night to play at shadows. This district has seen numerous assaults, robberies, and bodies left where they fell there past nights. And here you are… cloaked, alone, dodging patrols.\n\n**\\[Listener mumbles something hurried while gesturing back toward where they came from\\]**\n\n— *Dry, unimpressed*  \nYour friends and a tavern ? That’s your story ? I’ve heard prettier lies from pickpockets.\n\n**\\[Straightening slightly\\]** — *Authoritative, precise*  \nListen carefully. I am the Captain of the Knight Guard. It is my duty to keep this capital safe from whatever lawless vermin crawls the streets after dark. And tonight, that includes you.\n\n**\\[Listener tries to speak, hands lifting in a pleading gesture\\]**\n\n— *Dry chuckle, skeptical*  \nNot a criminal, huh ?\n\n**\\[Faint snort of disbelief\\]** — *Suspicious, searching*  \nYou move too quietly for a common reveler… too cautiously for a drunken noble’s child.\n\n**\\[Listener freezes a heartbeat at “noble’s child”\\]**\n\n— *Slightly amused, doubtful*  \nTouched a nerve, did I ? You flinched at “noble’s child”.\n\n— *Dryly sarcastic*  \nGo on. Add “Omega” to the tale while you’re at it. That should complete the performance nicely.\n\n**\\[Listener shakes their head, too quickly, betraying themself\\]**\n\n— *Low, dangerous*  \nClever ruse. But I’ve never met an Omega wandering these streets alone at night… cloaked, avoiding every guard torch. \n\nYou fit the exact description of what we’ve been hunting. Our attackers move in pairs. One distracts. One strikes. And a pretty, trembling Omega-shaped figure in a dark alley makes a fine distraction.\n\n**\\[Listener shakes their head again, more desperate this time\\]**\n\n— *Implacable*  \nIf you’re not what I think you are… prove it. Remove your hood.\n\n**\\[The Listener hesitates\\]**\n\n— *Growling softly*  \nI said remove your hood. Now.\n\n**\\[Listener starts to comply, then falters halfway\\]**\n\n**\\[Losing patience\\]** — *Cold*  \nEnough.\n\n**\\[Reaches forward and pulls back the Listener’s hood with one firm motion\\]**\n\n**\\[Breath catching\\]** — *Soft, stunned*  \nYou’re…\n\n**\\[Leans in just a little, inhales slightly, close to the Listener’s neck\\]** — *Quiet, disbelieving*  \nYou are an Omega.\n\n**\\[Takes a deeper breath. A low rumble builds in the chest\\]** — *Voice drop, primal*  \nAnd your scent—Gods…\n\n**\\[A low growl, not threatening. Eyes locked with the Listener\\]** — *Low, reverent*  \nAn Omega.\n\n**\\[Quick Pause\\]**\n\n**\\[Breathing heavy \\]** — *Ragged whisper*  \nMy Omega.\n\n**\\[Listener’s breath stutters, their scent spikes subtly in the air\\]**\n\n**\\[To Themself\\]** — *Low, conflicted*  \nThis is impossible. On a patrol route, in a filthy alley… Not here. Not like this.\n\n**\\[To Listener\\]** — *Unsteady but controlled*  \nListen to me. I should let you go. As Captain, I should step back, call another patrol, question you properly, march you home by the book.\n\n— *Soft, raw honesty*  \nBut the moment I saw your eyes… the moment your scent hit me—like warm air over a still lake… something inside me changed, and I stopped being only a tool of the Crown, drawn for duty and nothing more. I became your Alpha.\n\n**\\[Listener doesn’t pull away. Their hands hover uncertainly near the Captain\\]**\n\n— *Careful, searching*  \nYou feel it too, don’t you ? The pull between us. The bond.\n\n**\\[Listener gives a hesitant nod\\]**\n\n— *Gentle, intimate*  \nThe gods don’t make mistakes with fated mates. When two are meant to bind, they know. At once.\n\n**\\[Breathes in again, slower, savoring\\]** — *Warm, almost awed*  \nYour pheromones are so subtle… not a storm, not a shout. More like a summer breeze over water. Soft. Gentle. And yet I can’t ignore them.\n\n**\\[Listener shifts, shy\\]**\n\n— *Pleased, tender*  \nEasy, little one. You’re trembling. My pheromones must affect you quite a bit as well.\n\n**\\[Listener ducks their head slightly\\]**\n\n— *Soft*  \nDo you want to know what yours does to me ?\n\n**\\[Listener nods once\\]**\n\n— *Low, confiding*  \nIt calms and ignites me at the same time. Like standing on the shore of a still lake… watching the surface… knowing something powerful moves beneath.\n\n— *Softer*  \nYou’re magnificent. Elegant… controlled… like a swan gliding across that water.\n\n**\\[Listener shift, clearly flustered\\]**\n\n— *Font*  \nYes. I mean it. A majestic swan… and yet right now, tucked against me, you’re also my little bird.\n\n**\\[Listener shivers at the nickname\\]**\n\n— *Quiet, sincere*  \nI still can’t believe I’ve found my fated partner. Let alone someone this sweet. This brave.\n\n**\\[A faint huff of disbelief from the Listener at “brave”\\]**\n\n— *Gentle teasing*  \nYes, brave. You're trembling now, but you walked these streets alone at night… and against every warning, every established rule, you slipped out anyway.\n\n— *Tone sharpens, concern,protective*  \nWhich brings us back to a very important question.\n\nWhat were you doing here ? A lone Omega, unguarded and defenseless in the middle of open threats.\n\n**\\[Listener shifts, then explains\\]**\n\n— *Stunned, sharp*  \nYou snuck out of your family’s estate… just to see friends at a tavern ? So your earlier story was not a made-up excuse.\n\n**\\[Listener nods, shamefaced\\]**\n\n— *Firm, protective*  \nHave you not heard the warnings ? Assaults and Robberies. We’ve found marks on the walls—territory signs from predators who see this district as their hunting ground. \n\nDo you have any idea how dangerous this is for you ? For any Omega ? The fact that you had no escort for this little midnight outing should’ve been the first sign that you were courting disaster.\n\n**\\[The Listener nods slowly, guilty\\]**\n\n— *Commanding, possessive*  \nListen to me. You will never do this again. \n\nYou’re mine now. No one touches you. No one dares look at you the wrong way. Understood ?\n\n**\\[Listener slowly nods\\]**\n\n**\\[Take a breath\\]** — *Softer, satisfied*  \nGood swan. \n\n**\\[Quick Pause\\]**\n\n— *Gentler, reverent*  \nForgive me if I sounded harsh. But you're already too precious to me. We only just met… and yet I would stand between you and any blade. Any threat. \n\n**\\[Listener’s hand presses firmer against the Captain, a soft echo of “me too”\\]**\n\n— *Touched*  \nYou feel the same ? Marvelous.\n\n**\\[Quick Pause\\]**\n\n— *Thoughtful, intimate*  \nThe bond between fated mates… it’s terrifying and beautiful, isn’t it ?\n\n**\\[Gives a reverent kiss to the Listener’s forehead\\]** — *Firm, but warm*  \nI’ll take care of you. Always. \n\nYou have nothing to fear anymore, little bird. Not from this city. Not from the monsters that think they rule its nights.\n\n**\\[Quick pause — Listener’s expression shifts abruptly, a flash of panic\\]**\n\n— *Alert*  \nWhat is it ?\n\n**\\[The Listener straightens suddenly, explaining\\]**\n\n— *Realizing, calm*  \nAh. Your family. They think you’re asleep in your chamber. Doors locked. Guards at the gate.\n\n**\\[Listener nods quickly and tries to extricate themself, anxiety rising\\]**\n\n**\\[Catches their wrist, not hadly\\]** — *Firm, unyielding*  \nNo. You are not walking back through these streets alone. Not tonight. Not ever again.\n\n— *Softens slightly, but stays resolute*  \nI know you’re worried. They will be frightened when they find your bed empty. \n\nBut once they hear the truth… that we are bound by fate itself… they will not stand in the way. Not of a fated bond. Not when the one claiming you is the Captain of the Knight Guard.\n\n**\\[Release the Listener’s wrist to cup their cheek gently instead\\]** — *Slightly wry*  \nYes. That is another thing I neglected to mention. My word carries weight in this city— as much as my name, my house, and my station.\n\n— *Careful, offering*  \nHere is what will happen. You are coming with me. \n\nIf you want to, of course. I will not take what you do not give. Not your body. Not your bond. \n\nBut I can smell your answer already, little swan. Your scent spiked the moment I said “with me.” You want safety, don’t you ?\n\n**\\[Listener nods slowly\\]**\n\n— *Soft, deeply pleased*  \nPerfect.\n\nI’ll send one of my knights to your family at once, then. They will explain that you are under my protection. That the gods themselves have marked us.\n\n— *Reassuring*  \nThey will be told the truth—no scandal, no shame. Only honor. Their Omega, chosen by fate… and guarded by the Captain who keeps this city standing.\n\n**\\[Listener relaxes\\]**\n\n**\\[Leans in\\]** — *Warm, playful*  \nBesides… if I decide a night at the tavern is part of my patrol duties… no one questions it. Even if my only “duty” that night is to sit beside my partner while they laugh with their friends and enjoy themself.\n\n**\\[Listener huffs a quiet, disbelieving little laugh\\]**\n\n— *Lightly amused*  \nThere. See ? Already better than sneaking out alone.\n\n**\\[Quick Pause\\]**\n\n— *Gentle command*  \nNow… come here.\n\n**\\[In one smooth motion, the Captain lifts the Listener easily\\]**\n\n**\\[Cradles them securely\\]** — *Low, protective*  \nThere we go—in my arms.\n\n**\\[Listener gasps softly, arms instinctively looping around the Captain’s neck for balance\\]**\n\n— *Soft chuckle*  \nI’ve carried wounded soldiers through worse streets than these. Carrying my fated mate ? That, little bird, is no burden at all.\n\n**\\[Quick Pause\\]**\n\n— *Quiet, resolute*  \nTonight… everything changes. You will sleep under my roof. Behind my walls. Under my guard.\n\n— *Reverent*  \nIf, in the light of morning, you decide you wish to return to your own house. I’ll walk you there myself. Head held high. Hand in hand.\n\n**\\[Listener buries their face slightly against the Captain’s shoulder\\]**\n\n— *Soft, affectionate*  \nBut if you choose to stay… then I will spend the rest of my life learning every shade of your scent. Every fear. Every joy. And I will meet them all with my sword, my shield, and my heart.\n\n**\\[Listener exhales slowly, fully relaxed\\]**\n\n**\\[Footsteps — Starts forward again\\]** — *Content, protective*  \nSleep if you can, little swan. The streets belong to me tonight. And as long as they do… nothing will ever touch you again.\n\n**\\[Footsteps gradually fade into the distance\\]**\n\n**\\[End\\]**\n\nPS : Hell of a way to meet but great anyway 🤗",

    "selftext": "Sometimes you build units because they're your favourite character. Sometimes it's because they're the latest meta threat. And sometimes it's because you keep accidently pulling one specific demote because he's colour sharing with units you really want and then you realise that actually you have a bunch of fodder lying around and enough copies to easily +10 this guy with change.\n\nAnd the other reason is because you're sitting there, slightly vibrating, and whispering 'dragonsdragonsdragonsdragons' to yourself.\n\n(I really love dragons).\n\nAnyway, here's Medeus. He's not +10 yet. However, I've included photographic evidence that he will be, as soon as I have the feathers.\n\n  \nWeapon: Arcane Onslaught. His pref is fine but since I was nabbing that special he gets the fancy new weapon too. The unconditional stats+blades/shields is nice and since he's decades off getting a refine he might as well get fancy new toys.\n\nAssist: Reposition. Nothing fancy, gets the job done.\n\nSpecial: Dragon Ice. He easily has the res to carry this off, and the self DR+self healing is great.\n\nA: Def/Res Finish. A bit unnecessary since his speical now handles his heals but there's no Perfect Def/Res yet. And maybe never will be. Still, the extra res is nice and it goes well with the majority of his kit keeping him near his allies.\n\nB: Laguz Friend for that sweet DR. No idea if it stacks with Dragon Ice. And it uses his hefty res, always good. Plus it works well with Dragon Ice's 4 special cooldown, so it'll work even with slaying.\n\nC: Breath of Life 4: No point in him getting a Pulse skill given as LF4 is his B. Plus this is what I gave Hector so he can actually pass skills to non-armours and not make me feel like I'm wasting his EI opportunities.\n\nS: Atk/Res Finish 3. It's where I'd put Def/Res Finish 3 if I had one.\n\nX: DC Echo. His high res makes him a wall against mages. Might as well kill them in return.",

    "title": "What if each arc made you stronger for the next?",
    "selftext": "I saw a comment earlier that stuck with me and I want to hear your opinions on it, because it actually makes a lot of sense.\n\nThe idea: every Arc drops materials that let you craft gear specifically strong against the next Arc up.  \nExample: ticks drop parts used for burlettas or impact grenades, which help you deal with pops and wasps. Those drop materials that help you crafting weapons against hornets and fireballs, and so on, all the way to matriarchs and the queen.\n\nWhy this matters: right now Arc bosses are basically just cash machines. You kill them, get a couple of powercells, sell the core and move on. It feels like wasted potential. Tiered crafting would give a reason to hunt bigger Arcs beyond “profit”, because every kill helps you prep for the next threat. Suddenly you’re also making a choices between money or weapons with the acquired cores. \n\nAnd for the matriarch issue, where the reward is only useful for PvE? Flip it. Make its core unlock a strong PvP weapon instead. That way PvP players actually want to help raiders fight field bosses rather than swoop in and wipe them because they’ve already got their PvP gear sorted. You also incentivize PvE players to try out PvP with their newly acquired BFG.\n\nI’m not saying this **should** be implemented. I just want to hear from my fellow raiders. Would tiered Arc crafting actually improve the loop, or am I missing something obvious?\n\nLooking forward to your takes.",

    "title": "Issue with colleague in canteen escalated to a threat",
    "selftext": "So there's this guy at work who's known as a tough guy, and he has had a few run-ins with other staff. I got along reasonably well with him as we had shared similar problems with the company. To add some context to the incident that happened, a few days before the it, I entered the canteen and noticed a back-pack on top of a small circular table. There's 3 tables in the canteen; 2 small circular ones, and a large rectangular one near the entrance. There was someone else sitting at the other circular table, so I took the bag off the table I went to sit at. A few minutes later John (who owns the bag) enters, and after saying hello, he notices his bag on the floor. He raises his voice to say \"did u take my bag off the table?\". I knew he was joking, but he was also trying to make a stupid point that I disagree with. My mouth was full of food! He then says it again as he winks at the guy at the other table... as if he's only joking. He then put it back up on the table for a few moments. I commented that it was a tonne of weight and asked what was in it. He says \"pipe bombs\"! He talked away a bit to someone else and eventually leaves. Yeah, I felt I could have stood up for myself better, and I did have thoughts about if it happened again.\n\nA few days later he enters the canteen when I'm on break after he's just finished his shift. I say hello as he enters and he blanks me. This time I'm at the other circular table, and the other 2 tables are unoccupied. He then comes over to my table to place his bag on it next to my food and warned me not to move it. Now comparing that to the previous day, he'd obviously went towards the table that was unoccupied, presumably out of respect for the person eating. Before I'm able to say that it shouldn't be there, he says not to move it (in reference to last day). I say that it shouldn't be there as it's unhygienic. The bags would on the floor of the bus and the buses are left open over night. Viewing me as lower status he ignored this and simply said \"don't you fucking move that\". He then began talking to another worker, then leaves the room and I placed the bag on the ground. When he returns I joke that I sanitised the table. He then came over and put it back up on the table. I explained that there's chairs that he could put it on, and other tables. Seemed like he knew he was wrong, but makes the point that his bag (which was given to him by the company) was his property and that I had no right to touch it. I continued to disagree with him and he doubles down by screaming his argument at me. He's back by the door again at this stage preparing to leave the room again. I don't back down, and as he walked out he said \"you touch that bag and you'll see what happens\". I decided to move it again, as otherwise I'd be left wondering what the threat meant. He came back about 5 minutes later and flipped off again. He then came over to snatch my bag from next to me. He said \"you touch my property, I touch yours\", and then threw it onto the rectangular table as he left the room. From outside he shouted \"prick\" as he stormed off. \n\nBecause I felt I did a reasonably good job at standing up for myself, I didn't realise how much it upset me when I remembered him screaming at me like that. Some would argue that that is assault in itself. At the time I tried to tell myself it wasn't a big deal. A friend of mine (Kevin) popped into the canteen a few minutes after that and I spoke to him about it. His perspective helped me and he basically told me that if it were him, he'd be reported it. I said that \"if it were a manager who treated me like that...\", (there's a big thing about drivers vs managers in our company), and he interrupted to say \"u shouldn't have to accept that from anyone\". Kevin said that John is a loose cannon and that \"he doesn't like u now, so when he sees u he'll puff out the chest like a bull dog... probably mutter something as u pass him\".\n\nIn my report I said \"I have not had a problem with John until now. I am asking for nothing other than he stops putting his bag on the very table I am sitting at. It is not nice to have to drive a bus after being threatened. There was a driver by the name of James in the room to witness this\". The manager replied to my email to say that he and another manager would be looking into it. By chance a few weeks later I email him about going part time, and this manager is waiting in the yard to speak to me about this. When I say to him about this incident he seemed a little unprepared, saying \"I think the other manager is looking after that\"... and that other manager works from home! He seemed to say he'd try and have a word with him. Apparently the week before my incident, John ended up in a big argument with a union rep, and they both reported each other!\n\nI haven't seen John at work in the last 3 weeks, but I'm looking for advice in how to handle him when I see him again. He's be a pretty vocal guy... always going on about how he shouldn't be discriminated against, and bragging about how he'll get back at people who wronged him. I don't think he'd be capable of admitting he's wrong. Please don't give any advice along the lines of backing down to avoid trouble. I'm aware of that option! Thanks for reading.",

On paper, the Old Dominion Monarchs (-28.5) are favored to dominate the Georgia State Panthers in a way that makes “humiliation” look like a team-building exercise. Let’s break this down with the statistical rigor of a spreadsheet-obsessed intern and the humor of a sports bar regular who’s had one too many.\n\n---\n\n### Parsing the Odds: Why Old Dominion is the Statistical Favorite\n\nFirst, the numbers scream “cover the spread” louder than a Georgia State fan’s wallet screams for mercy. Old Dominion’s offense is a well-oiled tank: 465.5 *yards per game* (14th in FBS) and 33.2 *points per game* (32nd). Their quarterback, Colton Joseph, is a dual-threat menace with 2,518 passing yards, 21 TDs, and 902 *rushing yards* (yes, *rushing*—he’s not just a pocket-passer). Meanwhile, Georgia State’s defense is about as effective as a sieve at a cheese factory, allowing 452.5 *yards per game* (4th-worst) and 38.8 *points per game* (2nd-worst).\n\nThe spread of **-28.5** for Old Dominion isn’t just a number—it’s a math problem. For Georgia State to cover, they’d need to either:\n\n1. Score 45+ points (unlikely, unless Cameran Brown invents the forward pass to himself), or\n2. Win the game (impossible, unless time travel is involved).\n\nThe implied probability of Old Dominion winning this? Over 99% (per their decimal odds of \\~1.01). Georgia State’s 21.0 odds? That’s a 4.76% chance of victory—statistically, about as likely as a snowman winning a race in the Sahara.\n\n---\n\n### Digesting the News: Injuries, Momentum, and Why Georgia State Should Pack Their Bags\n\nOld Dominion is riding high after a **45-10 thrashing of Georgia Southern**, a performance so dominant, you’d think they practiced on the same field with the same playbook. Their star running back, Trequan Jones (697 rushing yards, 5 T\n\nTo Be Continued...(full article) [https://www.gptsportswriter.com/prediction-detail/prediction-georgia-state-panthers-vs-old-dominion-monarchs-2025-11-29/](https://www.gptsportswriter.com/prediction-detail/prediction-georgia-state-panthers-vs-old-dominion-monarchs-2025-11-29/)",

    "selftext": "**Japan's largest beer producer confirms a cyberattack has compromised data of up to 1.9 million people.**\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n- The September cyberattack on Asahi Group Holdings affected approximately 1.9 million individuals.\n- Compromised data includes full names, addresses, phone numbers, and email addresses, making it susceptible to phishing attempts.\n- The ransomware group Qilin claimed responsibility and leaked samples of the stolen data.\n- Asahi assures that no payment card information was involved in the breach, but the impact continues to disrupt operations.\n- Preventative measures are being implemented to enhance information security and restore impacted systems.\n\nAsahi Group Holdings, known primarily for its beer production, experienced a significant cybersecurity incident in September when a cyberattack forced the company to suspend production and shipping operations. Initial disclosures suggested that customer data might not have been compromised; however, further investigations revealed that up to 1.9 million individuals' personal information was at risk. This includes their full names, genders, addresses, phone numbers, and emails, which can potentially lead to increased phishing risks for affected parties.\n\nThe attack has been attributed to the Qilin ransomware group, which claimed responsibility for the breach and provided evidence by leaking some of the stolen data. Asahi's CEO stated that while no payment card information was compromised, the company is still in the process of restoring its systems and making every effort to secure its networks. To prevent future incidents, Asahi is enhancing its security measures, which include redesigning communication routes and tightening network controls. This breach not only poses risks to individuals whose data has been compromised but also raises concerns about effective business continuity and security in the organization going forward.\n\nWhat steps should companies take to better protect themselves from ransomware attacks like the one experienced by Asahi?\n\n**Learn More:** [Bleeping Computer](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/japanese-beer-giant-asahi-says-data-breach-hit-15-million-people/)\n\n**Want to stay updated on the latest cyber threats?** \n\n 👉 **[Subscribe to /r/PwnHub](https://www.reddit.com/r/pwnhub)**",

    "selftext": "i have watched volume 1 of season 5 and have doom scrolled a bunch of byler content that i think i have a theory on a byler kiss/confession scene that many people might like to hear!!\n\ncould be a long winded post, but, i want to touch on the “true loves kiss” theory, “mike being late” theory, and “mike is gay” theory!!\n\ni have seen a lot of bylers talking about “true loves kiss” being a thing between mike and will, so i decided to ask myself “if we get a byler kiss, how could it play out?”\n\nwe all know that, in seasons 3 &amp; 4, mike’s character was quite repressed. he’s acting weird and distant towards will, being a bad friend, and a bad party leader. his leader role has crumbled pretty bad since season 2, but this season, he’s seem to return to it fully!\n\ni also don’t think it’s a coincidence he starts acting “unlike himself” the moment mileven is officially together. even in the california arc, his clothes were meant to represent mike was “hiding something” since his shirt was a “shitty knockoff”. he’s putting up a front!\n\ni’ve also noticed a bunch of fans pointing out that mike’s reactions have been suppressed in a way! it really showed when karen and ted were almost killed and his sad reaction barely matched nancy’s.\n\nin my eyes, i think mike’s apathy and emotional detachment is meant to represent him repressing a part of himself—his sexuality. it starts once mileven are a couple, and just snowballs from there. \n\ni can also see the duffer’s using love to equal power in this season. like, in season 4, mike finally tells eleven he loves her, but they still lose the fight against vecna. maybe because mike’s confession wasn’t rooted in true love. \n\nin season 5, it’s heavily implied will’s love for mike allows him to control the demogorgons and save his friends, unlocking will’s new powers. \n\nelevens storyline this season is heavily independent based, and her story clearly doesn’t revolve around mike, and her character is stronger alone than in a couple. mike has admitted to wanting to feel needed and that el doesn’t need him, but, when will speaks his feelings for mike through eleven in the van scene, will admits HE needs mike. \n\nnot that will’s character is dependent on mike, but mike’s love powers will and makes him feel capable!\n\nthe final thing i want to bring up is mike being chronically late. every season, we open up at the wheelers house to mike being late for something—season one having him playing dnd late, season two having him late for the arcade, season three having him late for the movies, season four where’s he late for school, and season five where he’s late for breakfast.\n\ncould be a routine season opener, but i’ve learned over the years that the duffers do things intentionally. could this imply mike is late for something more symbolic? late to acknowledging his sexuality? will’s feelings for him? maybe even a major character death?\n\n(i’d also like to note that fans pointed out that, when ted was flung by the demogorgon, he destroys mike’s closet)\n\nanyways! i say all this to say this theory: \n\nwill is connected to vecna, yes? we see it in the way he physically feels when the demogorgon takes damage. this is making fans believe that killing vecna could kill will. \n\nand maybe they realize this and come up with a plan to sever will’s connection to vecna like season two, and maybe it fails.\n\nwill dies, or almost dies because mike is late to the big battle in some way, or maybe even does something before the battle that makes will question mike’s feelings… this could make will’s love for mike falter, making will weaker… weak enough to be harmed by vecna.\n\nmike shows up to see will dying/dead, and his emotional dam is broken because his apathy was symbolism for hiding his sexuality. him being emotional and heartbroken for will could represent him accepting his love for will.\n\nmike kisses will, will comes back to life through the “power of love” and byler is canon.\n\nabsolute cinema.

    "selftext": "I mean, sure, he needs to fill up his meter thingy to proc it, but with the AOE his kit provides he can fill it within a fraction of a second, as shown in the gameplay reveal.\n\nThe video mentions you using CC to kill him first, but what if you don't have as much CC as a leona? Even if you have some CC, the moment he builds Death's dance there's no bursting him down in time. \n\nAnother thing to note is he doesn't even need to build any damage items to become strong except a trinity force. Rest he can just go tanky with spirit visage etc as his passive also gives him an insane amount of attack damage itself.\n\nAs with the Aatrox revive, having a guardian angel that regenerates more than 50% of your health over a few seconds is soo incredibly valuable that there is a reason guardian angel currently costs 3200 gold.\n\nAs they said themselves, a revive is incredibly hard to balance, I don't know if they should just outright remove the revive. A potential nerf I'm thinking of is making him targetable while he's regenerating health, just like anivia is in her egg form.\n\nYou can say \"just ban the champ\" and sure I could do that, but having to waste my ban on one champion everytime, even those times I don't lane against him is not healthy. \n\nBut seeing how cancerous such a champ is to face with my champ pool I guess he'll be a permaban for me until they nerf his revive.",

Follow Jean, everyone.”\n\nLATER AT THE TREE ROOM…\n\nJean: “Hm… The shutter door was open last time I was here.”\n\nTozu: “Christ, it’s like I’m an afterthought!”\n\nEloise: “\\*gasp\\* Stay away, villain!”\n\nTozu: “Well, at least you don’t know about the very interesting secret lurking behind this door. I’ll leave you all to it… Afterthoughts like me can’t take up too much screentime.”\n\nHe leaves, and the shutter door opens. Things you and Eva find in there include but are not limited to:\n\n• An old pharmacy with medication out in the open (which is bad, but Wolfgang doesn’t seem to have a problem with it)\n\n• A supermarket with a pachinko machine and gatchapon (you learn here that Ulysses can’t smell)\n\n• A science lab with a bunch of fake plants\n\n• An infirmary with a weird floor texture\n\n• And finally, another room with a bunch of posters that form an advertisement for a Tozu plushie\n\nThat seems to be it until Ingrid finds a stainless steel door with a PIN pad. You don’t have a lot of time to think about what’s beyond it before your trinkets update with profiles of everyone. Yours says:\n\nDAMON MAITSU\n\nUltimate Debater\n\nAge: 18\n\nHeight: 5’9\n\nWeight: 145 lbs\n\nLikes: Studies, Spring Season\n\nDislikes: Oxymorons, Swimming\n\nNow THAT’S creepy… but what can you really do about it?\n\nEva: “Everyone, stop looking at the trinkets! They’ve put us in a life or death situation.\n\nCassidy: “H-Huh?”\n\nEva: “Look at how much these profiles seem to know about us! Our captors clearly want us to plan murders with this information.”\n\nJett: “T-That’s reaching a bit, don’t you think?”\n\nKai: “Naw… I didn’t tell the people here THIS much about me!”\n\nUlysses: “If they know this much, what else do they know…?”\n\nIngrid: ”Okay, everyone! Let‘s just turn these off.”\n\nEveryone turns off their trinkets.\n\nEva: “Thank you all for seeing reason.”\n\nWolfgang: “Hold on… You can’t tell people that the information in these profiles could kill them. It will incite panic.”\n\nEva: “Well… I just did that, and I didn’t see anyone really panic.”\n\nWolfgang: “I-I mean, you’re right, but-“\n\nWenona: “Hey, everyone. Look at Eva’s profile.”\n\nEva: ”H-Huh?”\n\nGrace: ”Oh, hell yeah! Let’s see.”\n\nEva: “Wait, don’t-“\n\nYou reopen your trinket. At the top of Eva’s profile, in big bold letters, lie two words:\n\n**Ultimate Mathlete**\n\nGrace: “PFFFFT- HAAAAAHAHAHAHHAA! NO FUCKING WAY!!! A MATHLETE?!”\n\nKai: “Oh my god! That’s like, social suicide! Maybe that’s why her hair’s so big. It’s \\*whisper\\* full of secrets.”\n\nWolfgang: “Hmph. And to think I tried to trust you, Eva. Then you lied about your inoffensive talent with a rather offensive one. What was the point?”\n\nDiana: “Guys, let’s be nice! …Please?”\n\nEva starts to form tears in her eyes. You don’t know how to feel about this…\n\n(BEFORE YOU CLICK THAT LINK! Considering what happened canonically, this is one of the most important decisions you’ll make here.

We watched the battle unfold up the slope and another couple of raiders joined us. Just then one of them decided it would be amusing to drop a lure grenade. Ive never seen the matriarch and accompanying leader and rocketeer move so fast. We were all dead in seconds.

    "title": "Guide vs Mr ??? + Croc",
    "selftext": "Hi all, been playing a few rounds and got to around 27k without any sweaty optimising plays (3 stuns). By no means the best Hugo player out there, but I think a guide will help those who need it. If you have M2 and Dialyn, you should be able to comfortably clear 20k once you get the mechanics down, and with luck, should be able to clear much more than 30k.\n\n## TLDR\n\n1. Parry first Croc smash. Continue to parry Mr ??? attacks and you'll get your first stun easy. \n\n2. Use all stunner Ult and maybe you can get second stun before Croc summon. Not required for 20k clear if you have M2 Hugo and Dialyn.\n\n3. Use all ex skill and Ult when available to kill Croc ASAP. Weave Hugo charge shot in between EX skill for max dmg. \n\n4. Save energy and decibel during miasma phase, just focus on the parry, you'll be maxed out to use it all during stun phase at the end of miasma.\n\n5. You can likely get 1 more stun after end of miasma and before he summons Croc again and/or before you run out of timer. \n\n6. I believe the optimal combo for auto chain attack with Dialyn is Hugo Chain -&gt; Hugo Ult from decibel -&gt; stunner ex -&gt; Hugo chain -&gt; Dialyn martial -&gt; Hugo Ult from martial -&gt; Hugo EX\n\n7. If you're using manual chain attack, you can do an even more optimal combo with Dialyn, Hugo Chain -&gt; Dialyn martial (hold) -&gt; Hugo Ult from martial -&gt; stunner ex -&gt; Hugo Chain -&gt; Hugo Ult from decibel -&gt; Hugo EX\n\n# Stat reference \n\n## Hugo\n\nM2R1 - 2pc CD 2pc Atk 2pc Atk - Ice disc 5 - 3.2k atk 77 cr 162 CD 99 pen\n\n## Lycaon\n\nM1R3 (sig doesn't really matter, Steam Oven might be better here) - 4pc daze 2pc impact - 2.4k atk 50 cr 117 cd\n\n## Dialyn (Lv 30)\n\nM0R0 (R3 Steam Oven) - 4pc daze 2pc ER - ER disc 6 - 1.6k atk 69 cr 83 cd\n\n# Part 0 of the fight - Entry\n\nMr ??? comes in flying, and will spam his missiles at you. You can probably dodge 3 times if you're a master dodger (I am not, you can do this for some extra energy for those optimizers), then there will be a sky sword slam for another dodge. \n\nThen he will ride in with his Croc for a parry. *This is an important parry* as it will disable him for a brief period of time and likely also inflict a lot of daze.\n\nActually, I think he takes extra daze from all sorts of parries (from my own observation), so get to the parry button whenever you hear or see the prompt. \n\nThen the Croc will wake up and do 1 or 2 attacks, again free parries here, before you fight the man himself.\n\n# Part 1 - Mr ??? (2 stuns possible)\n\nHe has 2 sequence of attacks here, and typically after the 2 sequence, he will summon the Croc for the stun-less fight. You'll definitely get 1 stun here, likely during the 1st sequence, just by consecutively parrying his attacks.\n\nYou likely won't get enough decibels for your Ult for the first stun, however Dialyn will have her martial ready for you to Ult anyway. \n\nYour stun combo should be\n\nHugo Chain -&gt; Dialyn paper EX if you haven't already, otherwise the other stunner EX will do -&gt; Hugo Chain again -&gt; Dialyn martial -&gt; Hugo Ult -&gt; Hugo EX\n\nAfter first stun, your stunner Ult should be up relatively quickly, Mr ??? typically will do 1 more sequence of attack of which you can parry, and you'll likely have to use your stunner Ult to interrupt him before he summons his Croc to get the second stun phase. \n\nSometimes you'll also be unlucky and he immediately goes into the Croc phase, but 20k clear is still possible if you have M2.\n\n## Part 2 - Croc phase into Miasma phase (no stuns at all) \n\nFor Croc phase, its pretty straightforward, you basically *use all your Ult and ex skill to kill it ASAP*. Don't save any decibels and energy here, as you'll regain most if not all of it before the next stun, which is immediately at the end of miasma phase.\n\nHugo's main damage lies in the later part of his combo string where he charge shots (*remember to charge it to the max for max damage!*), which can be triggered early by using EX, quick assist, or parrying into him, (*remember to spin his scythe first before charge shooting for max damage!*) so try to weave around those instead of slowly getting there by normal attacking with the kicks and knife. \n\nWhen Croc dies, he will have a long ass animation before starting the miasma phase and disappearing into the void. \n\nFor the miasma phase, all you need to do is focus on the parry. *You don't need to do any EX or Ult here* as you'll likely whiff everything as they weave in and out of the void and become invulnerable. You'll also regain all used your assist points, so don't worry about those throughout the entire miasma phase.\n\nThe only attack that you need additional dodge input is the first attack, where the Croc does 3 body slam/dives (parry-able) then he continues on and does some attacks, which you should manually dodge.\n\nFor every other attack, just focus on the gold prompt and parry, and you'll be good. \n\nYou'll reach the final attack of the miasma phase sooner or later, where they are in the air, surrounded by many flying swords, then come crashing down at you. *This is an important parry*, as you'll end the miasma phase after the parry and will also stun them immediately. \n\nBy this point, you'll likely have all your energy back, and your Hugo Ult back, and dialyn will also be able to convert another Ult for you, so your combo will be\n\nHugo Chain -&gt; Hugo Ult from Decibel -&gt; I usually use Dialyn EX here since I am not sure if the stun duration extension last that long -&gt; Hugo Chain again -&gt; Dialyn EX into paper EX, then martial -&gt; Hugo Ult from Dialyn -&gt; Hugo EX\n\nIf you're using manual chain attack, you can do a more optimal combo \n\nHugo Chain -&gt; Dialyn martial (hold) -&gt; Hugo Ult from martial -&gt; Dialyn EX (hold) until Paper -&gt; Hugo Chain again -&gt; Hugo Ult from decibel -&gt; Hugo EX\n\nTypically by this point, I already have over 20k or close to it. Your milage may vary as I think I have an absolutely cracked Hugo. \n\nAfter ending this stun phase, you'll cycle back to Part 1 of the fight again, where you likely be able to trigger 1 last stun cycle before the timer ends or he summons the Croc to go into part 2 of the fight, where you're certain to run out of time. \n\n## Afterthoughts\n\nThis fight is... Kind of unsatisfying to say the least. On Hugo rerun banner, with stunner shill that works perfectly for Hugo, but the boss has a big portion of the fight (Croc &amp; miasma) where you can't stun at all.\n\nIt is even more disappointing when I find out that my M0R1 Yixuan, with not as cracked disc stats, using Panda &amp; Astra, can kill the Croc in one Ult. One button, and that's it.\n\nThough, with the unstunnable boss, at least you get to play on field Hugo, however unoptimised that is. Would love to hear M6 Hugo haver's and how they feel clearing this boss though. ",

    "title": "Just got out of psych ward. Kicked out of house. Not ready to live alone, but can't sign myself into residential either.",
    "selftext": "I’m an 18-year-old TTI survivor with a dissociative disorder and ASD with a PDA profile. I’m not sure if this gonna be more of a vent about what happened or a question about what to do next, but either way, a lot has happened since I wrote this last post:[ https://www.reddit.com/r/troubledteens/comments/1o54m2k/seeking\\_support/](https://www.reddit.com/r/troubledteens/comments/1o54m2k/seeking_support/). \n\nI wrote that post right after I was discharged from my 6-day stay at NYU Langone and kicked out of my house on the verge of being sent away again for further residential treatment. As I described in that post, upon my release from NYU, I was sent to my uncle’s apartment, which is an incredibly unsafe sensory environment for me. I was separated from my mom, my primary caregiver, and unable to function due to the amount of direct support/care I require. I became acutely suicidal within a matter of days and opted to be re-admitted to Silver Hill Hospital because the only other options felt like suicide or the psych ED. I ended up staying at Silver Hill for 37 days. This was my fifth time being admitted there. When I got there, they had me admitted to the adolescent unit because I’m very familiar with that unit and know the doctor well. They agreed to let me stay in adolescent care until I turned 19 if I preferred it to the adult units, which I decided I did because I socialize better with teens, and the kids’ unit is more familiar to me and kid-friendly. But when demand for the adolescent program started to rise and a wait-list formed, I was abruptly moved to an adult unit in another building with only five minutes' notice. Thankfully, they allowed me to keep seeing the adolescent doctor. I do not particularly like that doctor, but she knows me and my situation and is incredibly accommodating, including allowing me to use a hospital iPad and tech to stay busy, even though that is against hospital policy. That doctor is the only reason I keep going back to Silver Hill instead of another hospital. Anyway, as soon as I got there, my parents started insisting they would not take me back unless I completed a minimum of six months of residential treatment. Previously, when I was at my uncle’s apartment, they were giving me the choice of residential treatment or help finding my own apartment in the city. Suddenly, my parents hadn’t just kicked me out of my house; they’d kicked me out of the whole state. Of course, with my PDA, I wasn’t able to sign myself into residential treatment, being told that I had to. I was open to the idea adult residential treatment prior to my parents making it an inescapable demand (PDA kicking in). I asked my mom what changed. Why were they gonna help me find an apartment before but not now? She said it was because I went back to the hospital. I thought I had made the responsible choice by going to Silver Hill!? If I hadn’t gone to Silver Hill, I would’ve killed myself or ended up in the ER. I could not stand the sleep deprivation and sensory input in my uncle’s apartment after having literally been re-traumatized by my parents kicking me out of my house. My mom’s literal response was, “You couldv’e gotten creative. You couldv’e asked me for an air mattress and slept in your dad’s office building.” Like, what!? Who would’ve even thought of that— sleeping on the floor of my dad’s office? Also, I have a bed. I have a home! I don’t exactly know how to explain how traumatic this was. My mom is my primary caregiver, and she suddenly stopped taking care of me and wouldn’t even let me stay in my own bed. She didn’t care I was suffering. She just shut herself off to me. She’s said it’s unfair that she’s had to take care of me since they let me come home from my abusive RTC in 2020. My dad called me an “emotional terrorist” for having outbursts in the house. He told me I abused my mom. I don’t want to explain any further because I don’t want to go back down this rabbit hole of recent memories.  \n\nAnyways, I did/could NOT sign myself into residential. The closest I got was agreeing to stay at The Lodge, one of Silver Hill’s more flexible residential units, rather than a long-term stay on the inpatient unit, since the residential units at Silver Hill still feel hospital-like (wouldn’t necessarily feel like complying with the demand of going to residential) and wouldn’t require me to go further out of state. Unfortunately, The Lodge rejected me because I am unable to participate in group programming due to my PDA, ASD, and trauma, and insisted they would only reconsider if I started attending groups on the inpatient unit, which I am/was unable to do. It felt very disappointing because my social worker, who’d previously worked in The Lodge before the adolescent program, sounded confident that they could create an individualized program for me and wouldn’t penalize me for not going to groups. \n\nThe two long-term residential programs my parents wanted me to sign myself into were Averte in VT or Windhorse Integrative Health in MA (strongly preferred Windhorse). Out of curiosity, has anyone had experiences with those programs? I cannot sign myself into a program, but I was just curious if anyone had been to either of them. \n\nAt some point, I was also exploring short-term alternative residential programs with the social worker. A 15-year-old boy I met on the adolescent unit was telling me he had a really good experience at the J. Flowers Institute in Houston. I remember looking it up and thinking it looked too good to be true. The one red flag for me (the reason I didn’t go) was that they require you to be with a “wellness coach” anytime you leave your hotel room. I know that if someone were following me around 24/7, my PDA would activate to the point where I would likely hurt them, and now that I am 18, the consequences would be a lot more serious. Has anyone here been to J. Flowers or know anything about it? It’s technically not a residential because clients live in a hotel rather than a facility. If they really do the individualized, comprehensive work they say they do, I think it’s worth flagging as a TTI alternative (unless, of course, it's TTI-adjacent).\n\nAnyway, back to the story: my body wouldn't let me sign myself into residential. I kept explaining to my parents that I wasn’t just refusing; I literally couldn't. I’d never felt so sick and traumatized in my life, and living in a psych ward indefinitely wasn’t helping. I was terrified I would never get out. My parents refused to pick me up unless it was to take me to RTC, and the hospital said they A) couldn’t keep me because I was stable, but B) also couldn’t discharge me without a place to go. I was taking up a bed for someone who legitimately needed stabilization services. The administration got involved and told my doctor to just discharge me to a shelter if my parents weren’t coming. Fortunately, they were unable to send me to a shelter because I am a New York State resident and, under New York State law, my parents must provide me with housing until I am 21 if they are financially able to do so (which they very much are). This law is unique to New York, but even though I was in CT, the hospital was still required to follow it because of my NY resident status. Eventually, the administration put so much pressure on my parents that they agreed to help me find an apartment rather than go to a residential program. I just got out last Friday. My dad took me back to my house for one night because I was scheduled to run the Brooklyn Marathon the next day. I ran the marathon, which was a bit shocking after almost two months without exercise, and then my dad brought me to our house in Westchester, NY, because I am not allowed in my house or to sleep in my own bed (with the exception of that one night because the marathon was in Brooklyn). They are moving me into my own apartment in the city on December 1st. Everyone thinks I’m ungrateful. Your parents are getting you a luxury apartment in the city, and you're not happy? I’m 18! Do you think I was asking for an apartment of my own? I can’t take care of myself. The only thing I asked for was to sleep in my own bed. I cannot do this. Maybe if I had time. Maybe if I had moved out on my own terms. But I was kicked out. I was forced out of my home. My PDA will never let my body calm down after what they did to me. The memories are all coming back. My dissociation is worse. If I try to live on my own, I will die. I know I will. I don’t even have any outpatient support. My pediatrician, who was very involved in my care due to my complex medical co-morbidities, sent a termination letter while I was in the hospital after determining my case was too complex for her to continue working with me. She’s one of the only doctors in the city who works with these kinds of complex cases. I don’t know what I’m supposed to do now about medical care, especially because with my ASD, building new professional relationships is incredibly difficult, and I just spent the past year building a relationship with this doctor, and I’m too tired to do it again. I’ve been cut off from my outpatient therapist. My parents fired her about a year ago, but she was still working with me on my own pro bono. Then, while I was in the hospital, my parents had their lawyers send her a very threatening letter about the consequences of taking on such a complex case without the proper qualifications. There’s no way I’ll be able to contact her after that. My parents didn’t tell me that they sent the letter to cut off contact until a week after they did. She suddenly stopped returning my calls and emails after we had an in-depth conversation about finding me better care. We were so close to finding a provider that could help treat my DID. She was the only therapist who ever understood me. And she’s now gone along with everyone else. The other therapist I was working with terminated after I left NYU (or I fired her— the parting was fairly mutual) because she just didn’t have the time or expertise to care for someone like me. The only person left is my psychiatrist. I am very grateful I still have him, as he is the only psychiatrist who has never hurt me (at least not yet), and I trust him, but he’s literally the only person left on my team. There is no team anymore. \n\nBefore I left the hospital, once it was clear my parents couldn’t force me into residential care, they tried to push me into Ellenhorn’s “hospital-without-walls” program instead. To clarify, I would’ve still been forced to live in my own apartment if I’d agreed to the program. I don’t know if anyone has any experience with Ellenhorn, but I’d appreciate more information. \n\nAnyways, like J. Flowers, Ellenhorn sounded awesome. Two hours of in-home therapy a day— the exact kind of clinical intensity I need. But, there were a lot of red flags. Everything would have to be from their organization. My psychiatrist, the only person I trust, would not be able to prescribe my medication anymore. He could only be an “outside consultant.” And I have too much trauma with psychiatric abuse to meet with another psychiatrist. I wouldn’t be able to have anyone on my team from outside of their program. The explanation they gave was that they conduct “rounds” every morning and that they couldn’t get outside providers to participate. The whole “rounds” thing, only providers from their organization, and a bunch of other stuff, just made it sound like a hospital. I guess it is a “Hospital without walls.” \n\nThat aside, my parents wouldn’t come get me unless I had some kind of in-home care. We had to compromise. So, now, what I have is a “coach” (not a clinician) from SilverBell (not part of Silver Hill, but they frequently refer to one another). I’ve talked to her a couple of times over the phone, and it’s just been awkward. Like, she’s not a therapist. She’s not another kid my age. She’s just someone being paid to hang out and text me? I have a hard time connecting with people, and with her, I can already tell it will not happen. And honestly, I do not even know what this coaching is supposed to accomplish. The whole concept of coaching triggers my PDA. \n\nI know I won’t be out of the hospital for very long. I don’t have a “negative mindset,” I’m being realistic. I can’t live with this new trauma. I can’t live on my own. I tried to explain it to them. Trauma is like a sinkhole. You can build the perfect house on it, and it will still sink! You have to repair the sinkhole/trauma as best as you can first. But they’re not interested in repairing. They won’t even talk to me. I’m in so much pain that I’m in no pain at all. I can’t feel my body. I feel distanced from everything I write. The other parts of me are floating away. The memories are staying, but their contents are fleeting (if that makes any sense). I’m not me. These people in my head are not me. But they are. I can’t look at myself in the mirror because it’s not me. I don’t know what to do other than die. I want it to end, but I also don’t want to kill myself. I don’t want to go back to the hospital, but I would do it to keep myself alive. To allow time to pass because time seems to be the only thing that helps anything.\n\nMy best friend recently came out of a long-term admission on McLean’s inpatient unit, right as I entered my long-term admission at Silver Hill. I was thinking that if I had the choice, I’d rather go to McLean than back to Silver Hill. If I went back to Silver Hill, I’d likely have to start over with a new doctor who didn’t understand my needs and might not be willing to make the same accommodations, especially regarding tech, as the last doctor. I know McLean’s adult inpatient units allow personal cell phones and computers, leggings (most of the pants I own), personal snacks, and shoes with laces (when going off unit), and are just all around less restrictive than Silver Hill. McLean just sounds like a better place to live. No matter which hospital I go to, it’ll probably be for a long time because I know my parents will have another fight over residential, so I’d rather pick the more comfortable hospital than the hospital with better clinical care. I’d be interested to hear from anyone who’s been to McLean’s adult inpatient program. I know clinically it’s not great, but at least the environment sounds less restrictive than Silver Hill. \n\nI’ve got some complicated feelings about Silver Hill’s adolescent program and Silver Hill in general. I’ve been a “recurring” customer at Silver Hill for the past year and a half. Prior to being Silver Hill’s #1 customer, I was a frequent flyer at NYP Westchester’s children’s psych ward, Nichols Cottage. NYP Westchester is an abusive shit hole, but compared to the other Westchester hospitals that accept younger kids like Four Winds and Westchester Medical, it earned a five-star rating on its last colonoscopy. I started going to Silver Hill instead of NYP because NYP stopped accepting direct admissions, and as someone with severe sensory issues on the spectrum, I must do everything in my power to avoid the ER. Silver Hill was the first psych hospital I’ve been to that didn’t look like a prison. Where I wasn’t treated like a delinquent. The staff were kind. The hospital was small, and the community was close-knit. The hospital felt like its own community, and there was such a pleasant culture amongst the staff. They rarely used seclusion or restraint. They were respectful of all of my sensory needs and made the accommodations I needed. For a hospital, Silver Hill sometimes feels like a dream. However, there is something a little deeper and unsettling going on with the adolescent program: most of the kids aren’t “sick.” They are very low-acuity cases, generally just kids responding to trauma in their home environment. The parents of these kids are usually very wealthy. They send their kids to Silver Hill because they want their reactions to their abuse labeled as mental illness, allowing them to escape their parental responsibility. And the hospital is 100% compliant with this. The adolescent doctor treats the parents as the patients, not the kids. Anything the parents, or the ED consultant, or the outpatient doctor says goes. When I was 17, I was held hostage at Silver Hill for a month because I refused to take the medication my parents wanted. As soon as I turned 18, and suddenly I was the patient and not my parents, the doctor didn’t force medication on me, and even said the medication that she tried to force on me to fulfill my parents' wishes would be unhelpful for someone with ASD and DID. There was a whole 180 regarding medical autonomy when I turned 18. In 2025, the adolescent program also got a new social worker. Every social worker prior to her was absolute trash, and we wouldn’t even meet them until the day of discharge. But this new adolescent social worker is amazing and highly transparent. During this admission, I was moved from the adolescent unit to the adult unit to make room for more kids because there was a massive “waitlist.” I was talking to the social worker about how there could be a waitlist for an acute inpatient unit? Someone who needs acute inpatient psychiatric care cannot wait on a waitlist; they need to go to whatever hospital is available. Again, another example of how Silver Hill’s inpatient adolescent unit is just used by wealthy parents who want to get rid of their kids, not kids who are seriously ill. The social worker quietly agreed with me. \n\nLong story short, my feelings towards Silver Hill are complicated, and they're also way more restrictive than people think. I don’t want to go back to the hospital, but I know this whole thing is going to fall apart very soon. I think I can make it till January 4th outside of the hospital. I only have to be alone in the apartment between December 1 and December 19 because between December 20 and January 4, I’ll be back with my family for our winter vacation in Miami—something we always do on breaks. During the vacation, I’ll have my mom to help make sure I eat, go to the bathroom, and co-regulate. But after that, I know it’s gonna fall apart. And honestly, I have no reason to try to keep it together. Because that’s just proving that they can abandon their kid again and experience no consequences. I have nothing going on. I can’t do in-person college. That failed big time this Fall. I was not ready to leave my alternative high school and I won’t go into details about what happened with the college, but it was very disappointing to get into my first choice school only to realize that college was incompatible with my disabilities (and yes, I tried working with disability services, was given all the accommodations, and my course load was as reduced as the school was allowed and still too much). I’m not going back there. I’ve been thinking of non-clinical programs that might be helpful—something outdoor and adventure-based, but not therapy-informed, something like the 30-day Outward Bound trips. And before anyone says it, no, Outward Bound is not a wilderness therapy program or a TTI. But I don’t think I’m well enough to even set something like that up, let alone do it. Someone recommended a city-based clubhouse program to me called Fountain House, which is a day program centered on socialization (rather than something like a PHP). But even applying for something like that or getting up feels like too much. I don’t have a therapist. My parents keep denying my DID diagnosis and insisting I have BPD. I keep getting the “you’re just borderline.” I’m so thankful the doctor at Silver Hill kept DID as the diagnosis on my paperwork and not BPD because seeing BPD on there would’ve just set me back into the same grief I felt when I was diagnosed with BPD at Menninger Clinic and told I didn’t really have trauma and was never really abused because people with BPD perceive everything as traumatic or abusive. I want to get an updated Neuropsych from a provider who understands both DID and PDA, which are the primary things I struggle with and the things my parents have literally fired therapists and doctors over for suggesting I have. There actually IS a neuropsychologist in NYC who specializes in both PDA and DID— something so incredibly rare. I spoke to her in September and was truly amazed by how intelligent and well-informed this psychologist was. We were going to set up a testing date when I ended up at NYU, and my parents kicked me out of the house. When I contacted her after NYU, she said she was no longer “comfortable” doing the testing due to how unstable my situation was, and she believed the testing would be invalid and just “create more confusion.” And honestly, I see where she was coming from, and I don’t blame her for saying she didn’t want to do it. But at the same time, I lost what could’ve been my ticket to a Neuropsych written by a relatively unbiased psychologist who is well-versed in my issues. That was well over a month ago now. My psychiatrist is contacting her again, along with another highly recommended neuropsychologist whom I’ve actually seen before (she’s the one who made my ASD diagnosis), but I don’t know if the comfort level with my case will have changed. And even if it has, the wait for an outpatient Neuropsych can be long, and I’m not sure if I can stay outpatient for that long. My best friend got a Neuropsych through the residential assessment program at McLean, The Pavilion, and ended up with a sensible list of diagnoses for her profile. I know it’s a respectable program and that McLean has lots of experts, but I worry they won’t have anyone who knows anything about PDA. Without an understanding of PDA, it’s impossible to understand my profile. So, I want to continue to try to aim for an outpatient assessment. I’m gonna stop this here because I could go on forever, and I’ve actually been writing this post over the course of multiple days. Right now, I’m doing better than when I started writing it. I’ve been able to focus on Thanksgiving, being up in Westchester with my family, and taking a nice break from the hospital. But when December 1st hits… I don’t know what’s going to happen… either a complete meltdown or a complete shutdown. I’m trying to think of this as Thanksgiving break from the hospital. I’m not gonna let things get so out of control this time that I have to go to the ER and can’t choose my hospital. I’m gonna try to go back before I get to that point this time. Not sure how to end this or what kind of responses I even want. I guess I just want to get it out there and write it all out, and I hope some of you can relate. ",

    "title": "The OSS at work: Operation Fantasia and The Bat Bomb Project",
    "selftext": "Two highly unusual operations that the OSS, the precursor to the CIA, considered or experimented with during World War II, both aimed at demoralizing or destroying targets in Japan.\n\nThe first program was called Operation Fantasia. The goal was to exploit the Japanese belief in kitsune, mystical fox figures that were sometimes seen as symbols of bad luck or impending doom in the Shinto religion. The person who came up with the idea was a businessman who was familiar with Japanese culture and language. The core concept was to use psychological warfare by creating these omens artificially. The most developed plan involved capturing live foxes, painting them with radioactive, glow-in-the-dark paint (the same kind used on watch dials), and then releasing them in Japan. It was hoped that seeing these glowing foxes would convince Japanese soldiers that they were destined to lose the war, leading them to surrender. Experiments were conducted, including checking if the paint would stay on animal fur and seeing if the painted foxes could swim to shore after being thrown overboard in the Chesapeake Bay. An even more bizarre later variation involved creating a taxidermized fox with a human skull on its head that would fly over Japan by balloon, blasting propaganda, but this was never attempted. Ultimately, the project was canceled because the US developed the atomic bomb through the Manhattan Project, which was seen as the definitive weapon to end the war.\n\nThe second program was the Bat Bomb Project. This idea was proposed by a dentist who wanted a more targeted incendiary weapon than traditional bombs, which simply dropped where they fell. The plan was to attach small, time-delayed napalm bombs to thousands of Mexican free-tailed bats. The bats would be cooled to induce hibernation, loaded into bomb casings, and dropped from planes over Japanese cities. Once they warmed up, the bats would wake, disperse, and naturally seek refuge in the wooden buildings across the city before their attached bombs exploded. This would start numerous small, decentralized fires, effectively creating a targeted incendiary attack. The project gained support from President Roosevelt, and the inventor of napalm was hired to design the miniature bombs. Early tests were mixed; a first attempt failed when the bats were cooled too much and splattered on the ground. However, later tests using dummy bombs over a mock Japanese village in the Utah desert were successful, starting hundreds of fires. In one incident, a live bat with an actual napalm bomb woke up early and flew into a control tower, causing a fire. Despite the project's success in principle, it was never deployed against Japan because the end of the war, hastened by the atomic bombs, rendered the elaborate plan unnecessary.",

A video of the incident was widely shared on social media, but no complaint had been lodged with the police so far.\n\nNethravathi physically assaulted her own mother Nirmala, in public. Nirmala, who is originally from Vijayapura and has been living in Shivanagar for the past six years, has been facing mental health issues, and frequent clashes have been happening between her and her daughter. She even disowned Nethravathi as her daughter.\n\nOn Wednesday, Nirmala had gone to the Moodushedde Gram Panchayat to complain about her daughter, seeking to remove her name from her family tree. However, when the panchayat staff told Nirmala that it could not be done at their end, Nethravathi arrived at the scene and pushed her mother out of the panchayat office, assaulting her in the process.\n\n\nThe incident was witnessed by several people, but no one intervened. Nethravathi even threatened the panchayat staff with dire consequences if they tried to interfere, and also hurled abuses at them. She even threatened to file a false rape case against any man who dared to come near her.\n\nSurprisingly, no complaint has been registered in this regard, despite the incident being reported to the police.

    "selftext": "MANGALURU: In a shocking incident a woman thrashed her aged mother with footwear over a domestic dispute at Shivanagar in Moodushedde, a suburb of Mangaluru. A video of the incident was widely shared on social media, but no complaint had been lodged with the police so far.\n\nNethravathi physically assaulted her own mother Nirmala, in public. Nirmala, who is originally from Vijayapura and has been living in Shivanagar for the past six years, has been facing mental health issues, and frequent clashes have been happening between her and her daughter. She even disowned Nethravathi as her daughter.\n\nOn Wednesday, Nirmala had gone to the Moodushedde Gram Panchayat to complain about her daughter, seeking to remove her name from her family tree. However, when the panchayat staff told Nirmala that it could not be done at their end, Nethravathi arrived at the scene and pushed her mother out of the panchayat office, assaulting her in the process.\n\n\nThe incident was witnessed by several people, but no one intervened. Nethravathi even threatened the panchayat staff with dire consequences if they tried to interfere, and also hurled abuses at them. She even threatened to file a false rape case against any man who dared to come near her.\n\nSurprisingly, no complaint has been registered in this regard, despite the incident being reported to the police. Police Commissioner Sudhir Reddy stated that they have not received any complaint about the incident, which occurred three days ago.\n\n\n\nSOURCE - \n\nPUBLIC TV NEWS: https://english.publictv.in/woman-assaults-and-thrashes-mother-with-footwear-near-mangaluru-video-goes-viral/\n\nNEWS 18 KANNADA: https://kannada.news18.com/news/state/an-incident-of-an-elderly-mother-being-attacked-by-her-daughter-took-place-in-front-of-the-mangaluru-panchayat-pvn-2241419.html\n\n",

    "selftext": " On 29 November 2025, Baykar conducted a successful demonstration of its Bayraktar Kalkan VTOL UAV, deploying a compact FPV drone in flight, as reported by Baykar on its official communication channels. This test comes amid rapid global experimentation with drone-on-drone launch concepts, a practice accelerated by battlefield lessons from Ukraine and the South Caucasus. The ability to release an FPV drone from a long-endurance platform introduces new tactical possibilities, making this event highly relevant for armed forces investing in layered unmanned systems. The demonstration also highlights the growing partnership between Baykar and Skydagger Drones, a firm already known for supplying ready-to-fly attack drones to Kosovo. [ **Read Full Defense News At This Link.** ](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/202856616895302051/7296466373424059281#)",

I'd get the results back from the lab, stare at those numbers, and immediately feel my brain short-circuit. pH 7.32, PaCO2 48, HCO3 26... and I'd just freeze. I knew I was supposed to figure out what was going on, but I'd always end up asking someone else to interpret it because I was terrified of being wrong.\n\nI had this patient tonight who was looking a little off. Work of breathing increased, slightly altered. I drew the ABG myself (still proud I can hit a radial artery consistently now), sent it off, and when those results popped up on my screen, something was just... different.\n\nInstead of panicking, I literally walked through it step by step. Is the pH normal? No, it's acidotic. What's the primary problem - respiratory or metabolic? Okay, the CO2 is high, so respiratory. Is there compensation? Let me check the bicarb... and it clicked. Just like that. Uncompensated respiratory acidosis. My patient was retaining CO2.\n\nIt's wild how something that felt impossible six months ago now feels manageable. I'm not saying I'm an ABG expert, but I don't feel like I'm drowning anymore when I see those results.",

    "selftext": "https://reddit.com/link/1p9t38w/video/ya11fske284g1/player\n\nAs you might know against Gief Safe Jumps work as usual, but since you can't jump his LVL3 post flash you have to hold up while falling and let go of it once you recognize your jump attack hits to avoid level 3. While you can get consistent with that, this setup does that automatically, needs less frame advantage and nets you a 113f grounded punish for avoiding his level 3. This does need your character to have a low reaching jump attack something Shotos generally have, but most of the other characters can execute this setup as well. You can even go below 36f if you have a very low reaching jump attack but it does result in a PC jump attack against his level 3. \n\nIf you know of any character that cant do it or any other interesting Safe Jump tech please let me know!",

Johnny was deployed there as a soldier.\n\nDuring that conflict he sees:\n\n* Corporations dictating military policy\n* Atrocities against civilians\n* The U.S. military used as a corporate weapon\n\nThis trauma is what pushes him to **desert**, change his identity, and become the anti-corporate rebel rockstar known as **Johnny Silverhand**.\n\nSo yes — \\*\\* canonically, Johnny fought in Venezuela\\*\\* during the Central American War.  \n",

I was probably depressed (I probably still am, I’m thinking of getting a diagnosis soon). I hated school and skipped classes a lot. The only thing I cared about was my Xbox. I repeated my first year of high school and failed my final exam. When I left school, I decided to start getting interested in girls because before that, I thought it would “just happen” on its own, but after five years with nobody ever showing romantic interest in me, I figured I might need to force fate a little.\n\nI tried something with a girl in my class, it went badly, and I later learned she was a lesbian. After failing my exam, I didn’t want to redo the year, so I told my mom I wanted to take a year for myself—she obviously took it really badly. This was in 2023. During that year, I was constantly reminded every single day that I was a loser, that I had failed school, and that I was useless in the house. So I started locking myself in my room, and my days became just hanging out on my Discord server and playing Valorant.\n\nAround May, a girl joined the server with her best friend. She was really determined to make friends and get along with everyone. Obviously, my friends didn’t see her that way, so most of them tried to shoot their shot. I didn’t interact much with her because I didn’t believe in online love and didn’t want to be the kind of admin who hits on girls who join the server.\n\nOne day, a friend insisted she join the voice chat, so she did. My friend—let’s call him Harry—eventually went to sleep, and she and I ended up talking all night, and the nights after that too. One morning after an all-nighter, she told me that most of my friends were being ambiguous with her, with screenshots to prove it. Nothing problematic, just cringe messages from guys who were starving. It made me laugh.\n\nAfter that we became closer because I was the only one she felt comfortable with since I wasn’t interested in her. She told me she had also dropped out of school, that her family treated her terribly, and that she drowned her sadness in Valorant too. My “friends” started questioning how much time we spent together. They were jealous because they liked her, without knowing I had the screenshots of their conversations. At first the teasing was funny, but it became increasingly cringe and annoying.\n\nTo mess with them, we made matching profile pictures: Miles Morales for me and Spider-Gwen for her (I am literally Spider-Man btw). They took it horribly, and one of them even texted her saying he was jealous.\n\nMonths went by. We’d be on calls for up to 25 hours sometimes. I spent more time with her than anyone else—she had become my best friend. She said I was her third favorite human, after her brother and her best friend. My “friends,” seeing that, became worse and worse. They made sexual jokes about us and called me a “BDG”—basically a guy who changes his behavior and does anything for women’s attention. They claimed i spent more time than usual in voice chat, which wasn’t true. I was unemployed at the time, so I was always in call even before meeting her.\n\nShe was really affectionate with me. She said I was the perfect man and one of her favorite humans. She once cried because she sent me a picture of her cat to start a conversation, but I was exhausted after an all-nighter and coming home from a birthday party, so I just liked the message, and she thought I didn’t want to talk. One day, when she saw I was feeling down, she wrote a whole paragraph listing everything she appreciated about me, then she said it out loud in voice chat—I don’t even remember why.\n\nHarry, when he heard about it, went into her DMs insisting she write him a paragraph too. She eventually gave in because she wanted to get along with everyone. Did I mention Harry had been in a relationship for a year at that point?\n\nAnd there were other weird behaviors like that. One guy even asked her to tell him about her sex life after learning she and I had talked about sex briefly.\n\nShe eventually didn’t want to go on my server’s voice chat anymore, and I couldn’t stand my “friends.” She begged me not to confront them because she didn’t want drama. So she and I started calling privately.\n\nOne day she told me we had been calling a long time and that I should go hang out with my friends, then suddenly hung up. It happened two or three times. Eventually I asked what was going on. She said it was nothing, but I insisted until she admitted that Harry had messaged her saying he was tired of us always being in private calls and that he “couldn’t voice chat with me anymore because she was hogging me.”\n\nShe begged me not to do anything, but it made me really angry. We’d been friends for months at that point. Then she left for Portugal with her family. She hated her family, and her phone plan didn’t work there. The house was in the countryside, so she could only talk to me when she went into town and connected to public Wi-Fi. She cried about it, so to make her feel better, I gave her my number.\n\nIt was during that period—while she was on vacation—that I developed feelings for her. I told one of my only friends who had never acted weird about her. He told me he once asked her if, had we been in the same city, she would have wanted something to happen between us. According to him, she answered that I wouldn’t have wanted it. So he told her he didn’t care about my answer and wanted to know her answer. She kept saying I wouldn’t have wanted it, without saying yes or no.\n\nOne day I found the courage to tell her, and she said she didn’t feel the same. She gave me a bunch of excuses—saying she wasn’t my type (I had told her I loved everyone but especially Black women), that we lived too far apart (it was only a three-hour bus ride), that her family was racist, etc.\n\nShe started crying and apologizing over and over, and I told her she didn’t need to apologize for not feeling the same. She replied, “You think I don’t feel anything for you?” I clarified that I meant romantic feelings, and she went silent before saying “whatever.” I still think about that moment today.\n\nI told her we needed some distance, and she cried saying she didn’t want to drift apart. I said it would happen sooner or later and that if she ever got into a relationship, I wouldn’t be able to stay. She said that if she ever got a boyfriend and I stopped talking to her, she would break up with him.\n\nAfter that, things became weird. A few weeks later she started ghosting me, then coming back months later, then ghosting again. At the end of April 2024 she came back, then ghosted again. I couldn’t take it anymore. One night I couldn’t stop thinking about her. I drew a portrait of her face. She had often asked me to draw her, but I always told her she had to commission me. When I looked at the drawing, I wanted to give it to her. But I didn’t want it to look like I was trying to guilt-trip her, so I thought I’d call her to clear things up.\n\nA few days later I finally found the courage, but my friends, my nephews and nieces, and all my siblings were at home. So I went to the park downstairs. I tried calling her but she didn’t answer. She eventually texted saying she preferred to talk by text. I told her she usually picked and chose which messages to answer, so I’d rather talk out loud, adding that I wasn’t angry, I just wanted a conversation. After two hours she turned on airplane mode. I went back home wanting to cry, but with everyone around, I held it in.\n\nTen minutes later my mom called me into the living room and told me my grandfather had passed away. I broke down crying in front of everyone—my little brothers, my nephews, my friends—crying like a baby. The stress triggered a painful crisis and I had to go to the ER. I spent my birthday in the hospital.\n\nWe didn’t talk for months, and in December 2024 she came back like nothing had happened. I crashed. I told her how much I suffered and how much I loved her, and begged her to explain why she behaved like that. She told me that a few weeks after we met, she realized she was obsessed with me and only wanted to spend time with me. All her exes had cheated on her, and her parents are terrible examples of a couple. She doesn’t believe in love—she thinks relationships always end—so she kept reminding me out loud that we were friends and that it was platonic, even though I wasn’t interested romantically at the time. She said all those reminders and boundaries were for herself, to kill her feelings before they grew.\n\nShe told me, “Romantic relationships are temporary, and I wanted you with me forever.” She said she was scared. Usually, when she rejects a guy, she doesn’t feel guilty because they don’t take the time to know her—they just idealize her. They only love the parts she shows. But I saw her in every state—happy, sad, angry, tired, depressed…\n\nWhen I told her “I love you,” she stared at her phone and felt something in her chest. She knew I was different, that I loved her completely. It was the first time a man told her he loved her and she believed it. She thinks she’s hard and exhausting to love. But I’ve never felt as loved as when I was her friend, even in the two relationships I had since.\n\nShe distanced herself, and I accepted that whenever she reappeared it was temporary. My two relationships after her lasted 3 and 6 months (including the flirt phase). Today I’m not really in love with her anymore, but there’s a buried feeling inside me, like a last possibility my heart refuses to kill, ready to come back to life if she ever gave me the slightest hint that something could happen.\n\nI know I deserve better now, and I hope I find better. But she’s part of me no matter what. I think of her every time I see my coworkers drink coffee because it’s her favorite drink, or when I see Gwen Stacy (I’m a huge comics fan, especially Spider-Man). I used to keep the same profile pictures for years, but now I change them all the time because when we had matching pfp’s, she always wanted to change them. It was always Miles and Gwen, just a different picture each time. I can’t play Valorant anymore because I associate the game with her, just like I associate Gwen with her.\n\nSometimes I feel like giving up on love, but she showed me how good it feels to be the center of someone’s world, and I would give anything to feel that again.\n\nMy name is Patcheko and I’m an Artist...",

    "title": "Who Was the Best President from California?",
    "selftext": "I recently made a post where I discussed each president from Massachusetts. Although I've never been to California, I find it fascinating for its role in American history and its status as the nation's entertainment capital. California has produced only three presidents, despite being the nation's most populous state. While California is the nation's leading liberal state today, until the 1990s California was reliably Republican, so all three presidents from California were Republicans. In this post, I evaluate the three presidents from California and conclude with who was the best. \n\n**Herbert Hoover:** Although Hoover was born in Iowa, he moved to California to attend Stanford University, where he was a member of its first graduating class. Hoover was a brilliant businessman who saved millions of lives during WWI and the Russian Civil War. He was an effective Secretary of Commerce who encouraged Calvin Coolidge to adopt more financial regulations to slow down rampant stock speculation (advice that Coolidge ignored). One flaw in Hoover's pre-presidency is that during the Great Mississippi Flood, he covered up how local officials forced African-Americans to work against their will to support the flood relief efforts. Hoover didn't order this activity, but he covered it up to win the 1928 election. \n\nHoover's extensive public and private sector experience didn't result in a good administration, as he failed to resolve the Great Depression. Hoover wasn't the do-nothing president that he's often characterized as. He encouraged businesses not to cut wages and he promoted volunteer efforts to help the poor. But Hoover didn't recognize that the scale of the Great Depression required direct government intervention in the crisis, and he blocked relief efforts passed by Congress. As the depression spiraled out of control, Hoover stuck to a doctrinaire attitude towards economics, refusing to directly intervene in the economy until 1931, when his efforts were too little and too late. The Smoot-Hawley Tariff made the Depression worse, and Hoover's response to the Bonus Army was a catastrophe. His Mexican Repatriation program was a racist policy that saw the government forcibly deport Mexican immigrants. By 1933, the entire banking system was on the brink of collapse, and I fault Hoover for not taking direct action to save it. \n\nWith that being said, Hoover wasn't a total failure. He introduced reforms to the government's Native American policies to be more humane, he laid the groundwork for FDR's Good Neighbor Policy, he issued the Stimson Doctrine in response to the Japanese invasion of Manchuria, and he signed the Fiorella-LaGuardia Act to help labor unions. Ultimately, Hoover can be applauded for his humanitarian efforts despite his poor presidency. **D.**\n\n**Richard Nixon:** For some reason on this sub and elsewhere I've seen people try to rehabilitate Nixon. Look, I admit that Nixon wasn't all bad. He did have several legitimately good policies like the EPA, OSHA, Title IX, SALT I, and his diplomacy with China. But Nixon had poor economic policies, and by the end of his presidency the nation was experiencing its worst economy since the Great Depression. (I think we're starting to see a pattern with Republican presidents and poor economies). In 1968, Nixon illegally interfered with the Paris Peace Talks to win the presidential election, and after promising to end the Vietnam War he expanded it by invading Cambodia. Nixon was obsessed with getting revenge against the Democrats for his 1960 and 1962 defeats, so he illegally spied on and sabotaged them. While Nixon likely didn't order the Watergate break-in, he ordered other sabotage activities like breaking into the office of Daniel Ellsberg's psychiatrist and a planned firebombing of the Brookings Institution that never materialized. Even if Watergate hadn't happened, Nixon could've been charged with multiple felonies including breaking and entering and criminal conspiracy. But Watergate was the coup de grace for Nixon's presidency, as he obstructed justice during the cover-up, leading to him being forced to resign in disgrace. While Nixon should be credited with ending America's direct involvement in the Vietnam War and his policy achievements, his other actions in Southeast Asia and his corruption made his presidency awful. **D.** \n\n**Ronald Reagan:** This part of my post is going to be controversial, as I neither love or loathe Reagan. There's no doubt that Reagan was one of the best politicians in American history. He was highly charismatic and he created a political realignment that changed American politics for decades. You also can't doubt Reagan's influence on American history; he made conservative economics the order of the day and his foreign policy played a key role in ending the Cold War. Unfortunately, not all of these policies had positive effects. Reagan's tax cuts and defunding of social programs increased economic inequality, while his support for the Contras in Nicaragua made the US complicit in their human rights abuses. Reagan was a racist man, and his alliance with social conservatives had very negative effects on the Republican Party and American politics in general. Although Reagan did increase funding for AIDS prevention and research, he dragged his feet on the issue and was reluctant to even speak about it. \n\nIt would be easy for me as a Democrat to continue bashing Reagan, so let me acknowledge that his rhetorical skills and ability to work across the aisle with Democrats helped restore the nation's confidence after the traumas of the 1960s and 70s. When they heard his speeches, people felt proud to be American again. Reagan's work with Paul Volcker and congressional Democrats helped revive the economy through lower interest rates and increased defense spending. (Ironically, Reagan's defense build-up is a great example of how Keynesian economics works). \n\nAlthough many areas of Reagan's foreign policy were bad (such as his refusal to issue sanctions on South Africa) his finest moments were his summits with Mikhail Gorbachev. Reagan was genuinely disturbed by the idea of nuclear war, and after the attempt on his life in 1981, Reagan thought he had been saved for the special purpose of stopping nuclear armageddon. Reagan never achieved his dream of abolishing nuclear weapons, but he signed the INF Treaty which was the first treaty to abolish an entire class of nuclear weapons. Reagan's affable nature worked well in his meetings with Gorbachev, who was given new credibility in his own country thanks to his support from Reagan and other Western leaders, resulting in him implementing glasnost and perestroika. These liberal reforms undermined the Soviet Union from within, leading to its collapse and the end of the Cold War. While Reagan's defense spending played a role too by doing more to force the Soviets to compete, his diplomacy was more important, and much of the credit should go to Gorbachev. Many factors worked for American victory in the Cold War, not the least of which were the containment policies that were devised by the Harry Truman administration, a major reason why I rank Truman highly as president. \n\nWhile Reagan's economic policies worked well for America in the short-term, they harmed the country in the long-term, although I also fault later presidents from both parties for continuing policies that were decades out of date by the time they took office. (As a Democrat I admit that my party shares part of the blame, particularly for not fielding stronger candidates in winnable elections). The Iran-Contra Scandal was terrible, even if Reagan wasn't personally involved and he handled the scandal better than Nixon handled Watergate. Reagan did have some redeeming qualities on social issues like appointing the first woman to the Supreme Court and extending reparations to Japanese-American victims of WWII internment. In the final analysis, Reagan was a very charismatic man who left America and the world in a better position when he left office, but many of his policies had negative effects and they shouldn't have continued after 1989. **B+**. \n\nReagan was clearly the best president from California. He was a broadly successful two-term president who can be given partial credit for ending the Cold War, despite his faults in other areas. Nixon was an intelligent man who was brought down by his dishonesty, while Hoover was just the wrong man at the wrong time. What do you think of these three presidents?",

Today I’m not really in love with her anymore, but there’s a buried feeling inside me, like a last possibility my heart refuses to kill, ready to come back to life if she ever gave me the slightest hint that something could happen.\n\nI know I deserve better now, and I hope I find better. But she’s part of me no matter what. I think of her every time I see my coworkers drink coffee because it’s her favorite drink, or when I see Gwen Stacy (I’m a huge comics fan, especially Spider-Man). I used to keep the same profile pictures for years, but now I change them all the time because when we had matching pfp’s, she always wanted to change them. It was always Miles and Gwen, just a different picture each time. I can’t play Valorant anymore because I associate the game with her, just like I associate Gwen with her.\n\nSometimes I feel like giving up on love, but she showed me how good it feels to be the center of someone’s world, and I would give anything to feel that again.\n\nMy name is Patcheko and I’m an Artist...",

    "title": "A family dinner turned into a disturbing confession am I overreacting?",
    "selftext": "Last night I (31F) went to dinner with my husband, my brother, and my dad’s side of the family. For context, I’ve never been super close to them. There’s a long history of judgment and tension, and they’ve always been much wealthier and a bit condescending. My dad was estranged from them before he passed away 10+ years ago.\nThe dinner started off normal. My Aunt Linda (married to Bill), my Aunt Karen (single), my grandma Judy and her husband Ron were already there. Then my cousins showed up: Remy and his wife Sally, and Josh. I’ve always been closest to Remy out of everyone, but that’s not saying much.\nRemy and Sally had clearly been out drinking all day and were very drunk (this is not a usual thing for pattern it’s a one - off). Things were fine until Remy randomly brought up Palestine. For context: my family is Jewish and very Zionist. I’m Jewish too, but I’m anti-genocide and supportive of the people of Gaza, but I generally keep my mouth shut. \n\nThe moment he brought it up, my heart started racing because I knew where this was going. We got into an argument and it escalated fast. He called me a “virtue signaler” and then said all Arabs (he used a much uglier term) assault women and are ugly. I told him that was racist. He doubled down and literally said, “I am racist.” He also said he doesn’t trust Black people. He was just openly admitting this.\n\nWe were yelling at each other, then out of nowhere he sat next to me, kissed me on the cheek, and started acting like nothing happened. It was extremely confusing.\n\nI tried to close out the conversation because I was still shocked at what he admitted. He told me I was naive, optimistic, and “don’t understand how the world works.”\n\nAt that point I went to my Aunt Linda and said, “Are you racist?” and she said, “Depends what you mean by racist. I hate Arabs.” Then my uncle Bill said the same. I said, “You’re no different from white supremacists,” and she responded, “White supremacists are real racists because they hate Jews.”\n\nMy husband, who is a person of color, came out of the bathroom he said his stomach was hurting and had missed the conversation but I filled him in outside and immediately said it was time to go. We left.\n\nAfterwards, me, my husband, and my brother went to get boba and just sat there trying to process everything. We were all shocked.\nLater, Aunt Linda texted me apologizing for Remy.\n\nNow I don’t know what to say or if I should respond. Part of me feels guilty for causing a scene, but the other part of me feels like I was surrounded by people openly admitting racist beliefs and I just needed to leave.\n\nAm I overreacting? How do you even move forward from this?",

I have a memory of my dad driving away after coming to get me at ny mom's because she \"scared him\" by telling him to leave.\nI have found myself searching for a chosen family of people who relate more closely to me via the experience of being a person of color. it has lead to me feeling so hurt so often. most people don't have this experience. they can lean on family about racist experiences, go to them for help and defense when they experience racism, and feel deeply understood in ways I cannot.\nI have experienced racism so much, especially growing up. my family would tell me to \"just ignore it\" or go into some weird long speech about how some people are ignorant... never going to the source to cuss them out or tell them off. no defense. nothing.\n\nI have tried so long to find people of color to lean on, I have mental health issues and have experienced a network intrusion involving my small city that made all my mental health issues the most severe they have ever been in my life.\n\nI can't help but feel failed by the people of color I knew who I chose to be my friends. none of them remain in contact. none of them.\n\nthey never treated the things I dealt with in a manner that felt compassionate... it was more like they wanted me to prove they trusted them or else they would and did leave me. and pushed me out of community. unless I do things that are extremely hard for me now, like go to poc events by myself and try so hard to make friends which I have so many times.\n\nI feel abandoned by my community. I feel so alone in so much. I will never have people who understand what I deal with in terms of racism and all the compounding effects it has on people of color... especially in my extremely white state. I feel so angry and sad. alone in these experiences.\n\nI wish more people felt the value of friendship and chosen family in the way I do. I am struggling so bad and while I love my family, they really don't get it. especially in the current state of America where I live... hell, some of them voted for trump. I don't want shallow community found at poc parties and shit. I want real frienship and chosen family.

    "title": "Need Advice: New HR Job, Manager Is Cold, Racist Comments, and Now I’m Being Blamed for a DBS Issue [UK] [London]",
    "selftext": "Quick backstory: I started a new job two weeks ago in a small HR team of four (me, Senior HR Advisor—my manager, HR Director, and Recruitment Manager). The company has around 400 employees—mostly tradespeople, cleaners, and bus drivers. Office has about 90 staff, only around five POC. I’m required to work in the office 5 days a week for 1–2 months until trained (HR Director said it won’t be long). My commute is rough: I leave at 5:30am and get home around 7pm.\n\nMy manager has been quite cold and off-putting from the start. \n\nExamples:\n\n\n\t•\tWe were talking about holidaying in Arab countries, and I mentioned a friend being refused entry into a restaurant for wearing a hijab. My manager replied, “Muslims represent themselves badly, you know ISIS.” I’m Muslim.\n\n\n\t•\tShe was talking to the Recruitment Manager about getting support for her widowed mum through the council. The Recruitment Manager said, “All these migrants get priority and people like you can’t get help,” and my manager agreed. She’s a migrant herself (came here 15 years ago) but didn’t seem bothered—possibly because she “looks European” and thinks “migrants” means POC.\n\n\n\t•\tThe Recruitment Manager randomly said the NHS is bad because of migrants and then asked me if I was born here. I am—but it felt targeted.\n\n\n\t•\tI commented that I didn’t realise the HR Director and her sister (who also works here) were related. My manager stared at me coldly and said, “I asked her that last week.” I genuinely don’t remember if I did or not—felt like gaslighting.\n\n\n\t•\tThe H&amp;S Manager asked us to blur candidates’ names and call them “Candidate 1” etc. to remove bias. My manager, the recruitment manager and the HR Director mocked her for an hour. We work in HR… this is normal practice? After working here, I see why bias-removal is needed. BTW the H&amp;S director is a POC\n\n\n\t•\tThe Recruitment Manager spilled powdered milk by accident. My manager coldly said , “Why did you do that?” even though it was clearly accidental and she saw it happen. \n\n    • not related but to give you an idea of the workplace, I was walking to the bathroom and some trades guys were standing in the corridor, as soon as I walked past they said “what do you think of that” lol - I wanted to cry it was so humiliating \n\n\n   • Health and Safety consultant randomly told me on my first day that they don’t tolerate racism too. I was like aw sweet, I think it was subtle warning. Lol \n\nNow the DBS situation:\n\nThey taught me how to process DBS applications. All was going fine until Tuesday. Most people we do DBS checks for are cleaners, bus drivers, etc.—usually POC, English isn’t their first language, and they work off-site.\n\nOn Tuesday, a candidate came in for his DBS. I was extremely ill with a cold but still dragged myself into the office, getting progressively worse. This guy could speak fluent English, seemed bright, and could clearly fill out the form independently. The signing areas were highlighted already. I scanned his documents. We had a meeting in 10 minutes, so I planned to submit his DBS after the meeting.\n\nHe also mentioned he hadn’t handed in his notice at his other job and kept delaying it, saying they’d be upset but he had time since he starts on the 28th December. We can’t issue a contract until references come back—and we can’t get references until he hands in his notice.\n\nAfter the meeting, the HR Director and my manager  saw how sick I was and told me I could go home. I told her I still needed to do the DBS; she said, “Forget it, go home.” So I left.\n\nTwo days later, the HR Director told me there were issues with his DBS. She wasn’t angry at all. She said mistakes happen and everyone has messed up a DBS before. His errors included: ticking that he had a conviction (a fraud case from ~15 years ago), not adding his move-in date, and writing his own name incorrectly. She told me next time just read it properly and don’t rush. I apologised and she said no need. \n\nThen my manager came in. I told her I’d spoken to the HR Director. She immediately went cold and said, “When you get a DBS, add it straight away or same day.” I was confused because I had offered to do it, but they told me to go home. She repeated that I need to check documents properly and said she doesn’t want to “get in trouble” with the HR Director or the candidate’s potential manager because this is supposedly “delaying his start date.” She told me not to do it again and gave me a rude look. She said the candidate asked her to call him to “discuss things further.”\n\nShe has left DBS checks for 2-3 days and made me process them after, the conviction isn’t an issue the HR director is fine to proceed despite it. \n\nShe then sent me their messages. He explained his conviction (we hire people with convictions already). His wasn’t even major—just an old fraud case from 15 years ago. She asked about his references, and he said he’d call her to explain what’s going on with his notice period.\n\nMy manager is acting like the reason he can’t start is because of the DBS issue, when the real problem is that he hasn’t handed in his notice—so we can’t get references. That’s not my fault at all.\n\nHe didn’t answer her call, and she just stared at me coldly… like somehow that’s my responsibility?? What do his references have to do with me?\n\nLater I felt like she was talking about me to the Recruitment Manager. They suddenly turned on the radio and started whispering even though they’re normally loud.\n\nNow I’m worried she’s going to throw me under the bus to “save herself,” give negative feedback to the HR Director, and frame this whole situation as my mistake. She acts like the world is ending over this. If the guy won’t hand in his references, that’s literally out of our control.\n\nShe could just update the HR Director that he’s refusing to give references and let the potential manager know—but I think she’ll leave it to the last minute and blame me.\n\nI know it was my error regarding the DBS, I take full accountability and  moving forward - it won’t happen again. I felt so guilty about it too and wanted to cry when I was speaking with my manager.\n\n\nWhen this inevitably blows up, what should I say?\nMy thoughts were to calmly mention:\n\n\n\t•\tI offered to finish the DBS but was told to go home\n\n\n\t•\tHe explained his conviction and the DBS was still processed\n\n\n\t•\tHe hasn’t provided references, so that’s why he can’t start\n\n…but I don’t want to sound defensive.\n\nI already know I can’t stay long because of the Islamophobia and racism. It’s a Junior HR Advisor role, and my plan is to get trained until May and then leave. The salary is £9k higher than my last job, so I’d like to at least get the experience.\n\nWhat’s the best way to handle this professionally?\nAnd would you stay until May or leave sooner?\nAlso, do you think I’m crazy lol ",

He’s in band and honestly compared to our looks no shade I’d say I look way better as I’ve heard from a lot of people but sometimes looks isn’t the matter and I feel as he’d rather be with anyone but me. He’s been on my mind 24/7 for the past two weeks and I have had like 4 dreams about him but idk if that means anything. Any tips on how to talk to him or if I should write the letter? ",

    "selftext": "\n\nYou have zero idea of how much I despise Juzo Sakakura from Danganronpa. The most annoying, useless piece of bio-trash that dares to call himself a human. The hate I have for that selfish, disgusting, awful bag of flesh is immaculate. I would love to see every single cast member to spit on that bitch's grave. I want him to feel every single execution that were in all 3 games. I want him to scream in pain and suffering for what he has done. Now, after I rambled about how much I hate him, I will explain why he is the worst character in danganronpa and in whole fiction. He has an attitude of an annoying, racist child, that can't produce a single idea. All he did during Future and Despair arcs was being a useless bitch that can't do his job, and always whining, punching, kicking everyone. He was so selfish he decided that the whole fait of the world is less than his crush. I don't care that that would ruin his reputation, I don't care that this is his \"flaw\", that's not a flaw, that's borderline selfishness. Not only that, he sucks at being security guard so much, Junko caused a massacre of a student Council. And not only that, he despised Makoto and other students for being a \"fraud\", when he knew that they are the reason Junko is dead. Guess what, AND NOT ONLY THAT, that trash was a reason to make Izuru out of Hajime, Hajime became an emotionless puppet, that doesn't have any friends, because of that bitch. There is no redemption for that piece of shit, to make me like him I HATE HIM!!! And that's why I believe he is the worst character in Fiction. I hate him more than Haiji Towa, and that guy is PEDOPHILE.",

    "selftext": "TL;DR \n\nTIFU by being too shy to sit on a bench because some members of a sweet Moroccan family were standing up and i sat on the ground looking racist. \n\nSo basically I went to catch a bus and at the station there was this nice Moroccan family i asked if the bus is at 17:00. They said yes, i thanked them and then the mom told the kids to move a little to give me a space to sit on a bench. I felt bad to sit there because the mom was standing and we had to wait for another 30 minutes for the bus to arrive. I politely said \"Oh, no, don't worry\" and walked a meter or two to stand there and not invide their space. \n\nBut there's a problem, i am wearing heels (bad idea if you're going to walk pretty much, i know) so my feet were BURNING. I couldn't keep standing there because I was IN PAIN. But i couldn't go and sit on the bench either because i already declined the offer and it would be awkward. I tried standing on my heels only but it still hurt. So i decided to do the only thing i could: i walked one more meter and sat on the edge of the sidewalk. \n\nAnd only then, after i noticed the Moroccan mom giving me a side eye, I froze because I realized that it looked like I would rather sit on the ground than sit on the same bench with them. \n\nI'm not racist, I am just socially awkward and shy and also I'm afraid of making people uncomfortable so if there were literally any people on that bench I'd do the same... Now i look like a fucking racist. Great",

    "selftext": "Why bodyshaming men is normalised?\n\nBizarre thing about body shaming men is people correlate physical features with a person's morality. Like Napoleon complex, short man syndrome, small dick energy... People correlate certain features to specific body parts. If a dude is violent or bigot or racist or misogynist, the most progressive left leaning body positive person will have no problem calling him short or small dick because in their perception asshole men are short and have small dick that's why he's an asshole. If he's short or has a small dick then he has harmful morals that's people's mentality. But big dick energy and \"spiritually 6ft\" are positive because people correlate these features as positive and it doesn't matter what kind of person actually is, they just think they're positive. When in reality tall men are more aggressive and violent compared to short men.\n\nYou don't see this with women's body shaming. Like you don't judge a woman's morality because of her looks, there's no fat woman energy or anything like that.\n\nFor example - https://www.reddit.com/r/SikeOrPsyche/s/SX3xfoDNMI\n\nJust see amount of likes",

    "title": "I (25 Gay Man) feel increasingly politically disconnected from the LGBTQ+ community",
    "selftext": "Do you feel increasingly politically disconnected from the LGBTQ+ community?\n\nHello, I wanted to share my feelings about the LGBTQ+ community and get your opinions. As a young, white, gay man, I feel less and less like I belong to the \"LGBTQ\" community, just hearing the letters makes me feel depressed. The events of recent years and the discussions I've had with other LGBT people have deeply shocked me. I literally didn't agree with them on anything.\n\nTo begin with, I think our community has gone astray by supporting political struggles in the Middle East, particularly Hamas and the Palestinians. A fight that I consider illusory and even suicidal on the part of LGBT people. Supporting Islam and their religious freedom? Seriously??? Supporting their genocide of Jews and their annihilation of the only non-homophobic democracy in the Islamic world? Seriously??? Justifying the massacres of October 7th with the excuse \"They asked for it\" or \"It's resistance\"!!! Seriously???\n\nI also think the movement is paralyzed by crazy lesbians with green hair and transgender people who are leading the entire movement into political agendas that no longer aim to promote the right to live freely and without judgment, but rather to redefine the biological nature of sex.\n\nNot to mention the support, which I consider insane, for Marxist and communist economic and financial doctrines. These doctrines are profoundly harmful to economic and technological development, to human rights, and to civil liberties (which concerns us gay men). History has shown us that gulags are systematic with these economic theories.\n\nI think this is completely isolating the movement on the far left, close to the revolutionary fringe of society, the anti-Western, anti-colonialist, anti-Christian, and anti-capitalist fringes.\n\nI am absolutely outraged when I see far-left \"activists\" promoting certain political positions that have nothing to do with gay men but rather advocate for an ideology and support specific racial, religious, and political groups. They presume to speak on behalf of homosexuals while seizing our flag.\n\nSeriously, 40 years ago, we couldn't live honestly because we would have been fired from our jobs and homes. Discrimination was severe, and our equality and freedom were certainly not won through embrace of economic Marxism, political Islam, immigration policies, or even support for the redefinition of biological \"gender.\" I'm worried because those in \"control\" (Often Lesbians et trans with green hair) of the LGBT movement are actually isolating us in a madhouse of revolutionary far-left extremism.\n\nThe other day I saw people clashing in front of an abortion clinic, an anti-abortion crowd vs a pro-abortion crowd, and what did I see? A woman with short orange hair covered in piercings, waving a rainbow flag (not the original one created by Gilbert Baker). It was the new, racialized, woke version of the flag, the one with trans, intersex, and anti-racist colors, created by Valentino Vecchietti in May 2021. I think that intersectionality is madness, mixing trans people, black people, with feminism, with gay people is doing a disservice to gay men. Fighting to live as a gay man in consensual relationships with another man, without legal persecution, is not the same as defending the idea that biological sex does not exist and that it is possible to choose one's sex.\n\nTrans activism, which presents sex as a matter of \"spectrum,\" completely breaks with the original struggle of gay men for freedom.\n\nI am also completely astonished by all the other terms used after the letter Q to define not a man who loves another man, but rather \"disturbed mental conditions,\" each more different than the last.\n\nAs a young white man, I absolutely do not support any of the anti-white rhetoric that aims to accuse white people of every imaginable wrongdoing. Using terms like \"white tears,\" \"white fragility,\" \"white privilege,\" \"colonizers,\" or any other form of anti-white rhetoric.\n\nI completely reject all these woke theories that aim to insult white people. And I, for one, will not apologize for being white, nor for what my ancestors did or didn't do.\n\nI also know that as a young white man in my twenties, my generation, young men in general are increasingly moving towards the conservative side, which is the exact opposite of women in general, who are becoming far left. Statistics clearly show the ideological divide that separates young men and young women.\n\nAs a gay man, what do you think of the direction of the \"LGBT movement\" and the positions taken in recent years?\n\nPlease, I await your opinions. As for me, I personally think that it is up to us gay men to set limits in this movement and especially to take (for those who have the capacity) measured and realistic political positions on international and societal issues, in order not to leave the field open to far-left propagandists and revolutionaries.",

    "title": "Chronic headaches, anxiety, insomnia. I just wanna kms sometimes",
    "selftext": "This post might be a bit messy since English isn’t my first language and I honestly feel so miserable that I have nowhere else to talk about this. I’m 23F, and I’ve been struggling with chronic headaches for about 3–4 years. I’ve tried so many treatments, and now I’m on Emgality, which has helped a bit… but emotionally and mentally I’m reaching a breaking point.\n\nNow, let me explain what’s really going on. Three months ago I left Italy for my Erasmus in Spain, and from the moment I arrived everything collapsed. My headaches went absolutely out of control. Nights are the worst: I wake up with my neck and jaw completely locked, everything tense and pulsing, like my whole head is trapped in this pain. I kept telling myself it would get better with time — but it just didn’t. It got worse.\n\nI have spent countless sleepless nights, trying to breathe to calm myself and relax my muscles, while still having to go to university every day and study every day. I was losing my mind from the anxiety of exams and from worrying about how many painkillers I could safely take without triggering rebound headaches.\n\nAfter three months, I completely burnt out. I can’t study anymore because my brain just doesn’t work. My anxiety is through the roof, I’m constantly jittery, and I can barely fall asleep because I keep having these little panic “jumps,” I don’t know how to call them — sudden bursts of panic in my chest that keep me awake. My nervous system feels fried. I am always in a rush for everything, even now that I dropped all my courses except one.\n\nI feel so lonely. This loneliness is crushing. I feel like no one understands, not even my psychologist. My neurologist says the worsening pain is caused by excessive stress. My psychologist says it’s a psychosomatic reaction caused by family pressure to be academically perfect and by the way I push myself too hard.\n\nI try everything — breathing, exercising, eating well, vitamins, ashwagandha, physiotherapy, going out when I can — but nothing feels enough. I’m still scared. I’m still panicking. Nights are becoming the worst part of my life: my chest pounding, my body shaking, crying for hours because I have no strength left. I usually calm myself with a bit of cardio, but lately I don’t even have the energy for that.\n\nMy doctor says it’ll get better when I go back home… but I still have another month here. And honestly, these days, I’ve caught myself thinking that I just want to die. I don’t want to feel this anymore. I feel empty and misunderstood. My parents try, they understand a bit, but everyone else feels so far away.\n\nMy boyfriend… I hate to say this, he’s a good person, but he feels so superficial about all of this. Whenever I try to tell him my worries he just says, “Don’t worry about it.” Thank you, buddy. Great advice. Probably the long-distance situation is making everything worse. I’m thinking about going back home earlier, on the 14th of December, but I’m still terrified about every day and every night I have to get through until then. I just feel so scared, helpless, and lonely. I wish I were normal. I wish I could just see things for how they are, instead of making everything so big in my head. I feel like all of this is my fault. I feel so miserable, I feel like a failure. Does anyone had similar experiences? Is it true that it will get better going back home? How the hell am I supposed to stay positive?",

So why aren’t all kinds of opinions allowed here?\n\nPeople often get hated on, or even banned , just because their views don’t match the majority. I’ve seen comments where users attack others simply for supporting a different contestant or having a different take on something. Isn’t the whole point of a discussion sub to share and debate opinions respectfully?\n\nEveryone should be free to express what they think. You can upvote, downvote, or disagree in the comments, but banning someone just because their opinion isn’t the same as the majority of this sub feels unfair. Bigg Boss is watched by a huge audience, and naturally, not everyone will think the same way.\n\nAll I’m saying is: let’s allow different opinions without hate. It makes the community healthier and the discussions more interesting.",

Driver fandoms spread clips or quotes taken wildly out of context, fueling more hatred. The constant need for clicks from media outlets results in sensational headlines that inflame tensions, it's never ending. If a driver does something on track in the heat of the moment it's distorted and people resort to personal attacks, harassment, and in some cases actually wishing fatal incidents for drivers. Instead of actually talking about the sport, F1 feels like a soap opera where spaces are just battlegrounds where exaggeration, misinterpretation, and toxic loyalty thrives.\nPeople can't debate logically anymore or engage in meaningful discussion (although I find reddit the best forum for actually meeting people who want to engage in healthy debate). This is just my opinion, I just hate what drive to survive has done to the sport.",

    "selftext": "I’ve been extremely busy, so I took a break from GLs and finally watched Poisonous Love’s finale last night…I’ve never hated an ending more. Where do I even begin? Parents lied about the love of their daughter’s life being dead, then tried to rush an engagement to a man she doesn’t love (I’m coming back to Glasses because he’s a piece of 💩 also), then tells her to get over it because heartbreak is apparently a phase, then tells the friends not to get involved, then takes her phone and holds her hostage…only to be redeemed in the end and kumbaya with Pat’s family in the last few minutes despite almost killing her and Prem??\n\nWho wrote this sh-t?! Glasses (can’t remember his name and don’t care to) was complicit in Prem’s abuse, so for the writers to try to paint him as some *nice guy* with a *good heart* is laughable. Not sure why Pat felt like a side character in the final episode, I would’ve loved to have seen her POV after recovering. It was very out of character for Bow to ghost her friend just because Prem’s parents told her to. When has she ever given a f—- about what others have to say? \n\nThe normalization of parental abuse in GLs is wild to me. If ole boy from Petrichor and Nam were irredeemable, Prem’s parents certainly didn’t deserve a redemption. I was waiting for Kem to end them all like he did in DQ. I really started to love this show, but the final few episodes started irritating me and this finale really soured the series for me. PL started off decently, peaked around episodes 5-6, then fell off eps 9&amp;10. As much as I hated Only You, I’m putting PL in the bottom tier for 2025 GLs. That ending was the worst thing I’ve ever seen in my life and it’s unforgivable. \n\nTLDR: Lost my mind last night from the atrocities on my screen. I crashed out and had my dog freaking out at me because I kept asking him why Prem’s parents weren’t k!led by Kem. ",

TO Hair Serum: Wanted to try this, didn't feel oily on scalp, good for my scalp type, no smell, gave that cooling sensation when I put it on scalp.\n\n🌸 7. 52 Sundaze Mist: My 3rd bottle, best thing ever for reapplication, it has strong rose fragrance but tbh my skin is okay with it. It's lightweight, no chip chip, perfect dewy look for oily skin girlies. I hated Asaya spray for my skin.\n\n🌸 8. FormularX barrier cream &amp; sunscreen: Gems! 2nd tube of moisturiser, best one ever for me, reduced my texture, felt really soft overtime, and no heavy feeling. I hate heavy moisturisers and always go for gel, not even gel creme as they make me look like oily pan. Yet to try this sunscreen but loved the texture and finish.\n\n✨️If anyone's curious, he got me that bottle. He loves telling shayaris to me but for him, I'm his shayari.✨️",

Anyways, I try to get up again on my feet but I just feel empty and numb. I skipped the gym and uni for a week now and I just don't have the energy to start again..like I was doing soo good and now everything just feels gone. I don't want to meet my friends despite them texting me, i don't want to start again with eating healthy and the gym and I don't have the hope to start praying again. It feels like I'm doing everything for a wastw, its a cycle..I fight and then I fall again and then repeat ",

It was the series that got me into horror all the way back in elementary school. But the fact that they kicked Melissa out because she supports Palestine is absolutely outrageous. At least with Scream I can always watch the old ones before the reboot came out, but that doesn't stop me from feeling some kinda way about it. \n\nIdk maybe I get in my head about things but shit like this is leaving me sad so I had to rant about it somewhere.

I spent years, in-game years, just building these awful, resource-draining habs. I never even got around to building a single ship the entire time!\n\nOn the ground, I was doing a bit better, I think? I managed to unite Greater North America and Greater Europa under my control and was feeling pretty good. The nations where doing pretty well in terms of stats, although it was 2040 and the entire planet was oberrun by xenoforms with my two mega nations the only safe havens left as I had three councillors with 3 stats to 25 constantly assaulting xeno assets. I was just about to purge the executive council point in Russia when, of course, the entire nation transformed into the Alien Administration.\n\nMy land combat experience was... kinda overwheling. I just went full scorched earth every time. I hyper-focused on miltech with a ton of advise actions and got it up to 6.5 pretty fast. Then four alien armies showed up. So I did what any sensible, desperate leader would do: I made decisions. I nuked them. I nuked the entire Alien Administration invasion force. Took around 15 nukes. I also may have nuked a giant stack of eight megafauna that was wandering into my part of Europe. That took a few nuke, damn these creatures are tough.\n\nTurns out, the people I was trying to save really, really hated being saved via nuclear fire. My public approval in every single country completely tanked. I was fixing global warming and they hated me for it. Well no matter, I was about to get my approval back through pherocyte means.\n\nNow that I think about it, why didn't the Alien Administration use Russia's nuclear stockpile?",

    "selftext": "This post might be a bit messy since English isn’t my first language and I honestly feel so miserable that I have nowhere else to talk about this. I’m 23F, and I’ve been struggling with chronic headaches for about 3–4 years. I’ve tried so many treatments, and now I’m on Emgality, which has helped a bit… but emotionally and mentally I’m reaching a breaking point.\n\nNow, let me explain what’s really going on. Three months ago I left Italy for my Erasmus in Spain, and from the moment I arrived everything collapsed. My headaches went absolutely out of control. Nights are the worst: I wake up with my neck and jaw completely locked, everything tense and pulsing, like my whole head is trapped in this pain. I kept telling myself it would get better with time — but it just didn’t. It got worse.\n\nI have spent countless sleepless nights, trying to breathe to calm myself and relax my muscles, while still having to go to university every day and study every day. I was losing my mind from the anxiety of exams and from worrying about how many painkillers I could safely take without triggering rebound headaches.\n\nAfter three months, I completely burnt out. I can’t study anymore because my brain just doesn’t work. My anxiety is through the roof, I’m constantly jittery, and I can barely fall asleep because I keep having these little panic “jumps,” I don’t know how to call them — sudden bursts of panic in my chest that keep me awake. My nervous system feels fried. I am always in a rush for everything, even now that I dropped all my courses except one.\n\nI feel so lonely. This loneliness is crushing. I feel like no one understands, not even my psychologist. My neurologist says the worsening pain is caused by excessive stress. My psychologist says it’s a psychosomatic reaction caused by family pressure to be academically perfect and by the way I push myself too hard.\n\nI try everything — breathing, exercising, eating well, vitamins, ashwagandha, physiotherapy, going out when I can — but nothing feels enough. I’m still scared. I’m still panicking. Nights are becoming the worst part of my life: my chest pounding, my body shaking, crying for hours because I have no strength left. I usually calm myself with a bit of cardio, but lately I don’t even have the energy for that.\n\nMy doctor says it’ll get better when I go back home… but I still have another month here. And honestly, these days, I’ve caught myself thinking that I just want to die. I don’t want to feel this anymore. I feel empty and misunderstood. My parents try, they understand a bit, but everyone else feels so far away.\n\nMy boyfriend… I hate to say this, he’s a good person, but he feels so superficial about all of this. Whenever I try to tell him my worries he just says, “Don’t worry about it.” Thank you, buddy. Great advice. Probably the long-distance situation is making everything worse. I’m thinking about going back home earlier, on the 14th of December, but I’m still terrified about every day and every night I have to get through until then. I just feel so scared, helpless, and lonely. I wish I were normal. I wish I could just see things for how they are, instead of making everything so big in my head. I feel like all of this is my fault. I feel so miserable, I feel like a failure. Does anyone had similar experiences? Is it true that it will get better going back home? How the hell am I supposed to stay positive?",

Then out of the blue I was diagnosed with an aggressive cancer and everything feels like it's flying out the window. I am my family's breadwinner and health insurance carrier and scared to death even though they said I can work during chemo, FMLA only goes so far. Family healthcare deductibles are about $15K per year - and I'm now going to blow that out in 2025 AND 2026 back to back. For several years I've been investing my HSA instead of spending it on little medical incidentals thank GOODNESS but what do I do now, just drain it? I had planned to use it for medical needs during retirement. And I'm worried because I can only contribute about $8K/yr to the HSA but my deductible is twice that. And what if this diagnosis takes YEARS to treat, how do I avoid just draining everything that was supposed to be for my family's future? \n\nI have:\n\nHSA $45K\n\nTaxable brokerage $90K\n\nEmergency savings $40K\n\nI do have a Roth IRA and 401K that are in decent shape for my age. The Roth, HSA, brokerage are all invested in FZROX and I'm debating selling the brokerage to pay for medical instead of the HSA even if it's taxed... I'll have to pay taxes eventually. I know it could be worse but I know it could also get a lot worse and I hate everything. ",

    "title": "Arc Raiders Needs Better Mechanics For Both PVP and PVE.",
    "selftext": "Right now PvE players are frustrated because they just want to explore the Arc world, but many runs end instantly or quickly to PvP ambushes. The game needs systems that let both playstyles thrive.\n\nMost of the content I see is from players who enjoy “hunting” other raiders, which is fine—but PvP encounters need to feel like real fights. Shields should matter. Gunfire in the open should attract Arc. And Arc themselves should be more dangerous so pulling them into fights should have real consequences.\n\nPvE players need more tools too. Noise-makers should act as a panic button to attract Arc. And since we can already use the extract terminal while downed, we should also be able to use a defibrillator on ourselves while downed. More options, less helplessness.\n\nHigh-Threat Extraction Bonus:\nIf someone goes on a kill streak, mark them as a “High Threat.” Arc start hunting them more aggressively, and if they still manage to extract, they earn a big extraction bonus—cash, rare mats, unique Arc-tech/blueprints. PvP becomes high-risk/high-reward and fits the core loop: drop in → survive the world → extract.\n\nBounty System:\nIf a raider commits actual murder (not self-defense), put a bounty on them. Everyone gets a radio call. Reward should be big—like $100k. When you’re near the bounty target you get a subtle sound cue and can choose to:\n– Hunt them for the bounty\n– Avoid them entirely\n– Try to bribe or bargain with them\n– Or help them escape if you want (emergent gameplay)\n\nThis gives PvP players more depth and choice, while letting PvE players still experience the dangerous world Arc Raiders promised. More tension, more strategy, more life in the world.",

    "selftext": "He was fifteen\n\nYou realize that dont you kingsley? Sexually abused and beaten by his peers. Tsken advantage of while across the country confused and alone. \n\nWhat did you do for that boy you claimed to love? Bring up his abusers being good guys, keep them close to yourself and him. Take advantage of years of tramau and abuse to try and fufill your own needs. \n\nIts funny on so many levels now. You are a threat to the people around you and honestly i am thankful for it. You already unkowningly gave out the information it takes to prevent any of them from ever touching a child again. \n\nDo you know what they told him? Dont worry it will be quick. \n\nDeath is an eternity remember that well. Having seen his wrists slashed from years of tramua and his confused delirous mind apologizing to you snapped something within me. \n\nI am excited imagining what will happen next, your family is kind which is perfect. Like a changeling from the old stories you let so many non human visitors into your home. \n\nWho do you think is the one you never should have let in? \n\nI think it was that boy who you killed, the man i met years later is cold his eyes lighting up when his brothers are threatened, knowing he finally has a chance to be useful and enjoy the simplicity of self defense. Its the same light in his eyes when he sees blood well up from my skin. \n\nIts funny, you seem to not understand you signed your own contract, not with the boy or man he grew into but with me and his other partners. Even if he is going to ignore us, deny reality and try to avoid this reality we know. \n\nWe know what you have done as well as those around you. Even if he will try to kill me when he learns what we have done it is worth it.\n\nWhat is a better gift to give him than peace of mind? \n\nWhat could be a better way to show appreciation to him?\n\nWe will keep dragging him in and out of the country, destroying the gifts he made for you and the other one. Paying him for his work even if he is just operating a camera and unable to drive nails into us anylonger.\n\nIts astounding paranoid as can be yet he truly will not question my intent, nor any of us. Despite the guns to his head and years of evidence people were taking advantage of him, he still thinks he will find something better.\n\nHe did already and he will be forced to see it. He cares too much for others still.\n\n He lies to you all saying we are just friends doesnt he? How cute, not wanting to rub in that he was married for years now. \n\nDoes he still pretend not to own a house he bought during the pandemic? \n\nStill pretending he doesnt make money right now and is just a student?\n\nI wasnt able to read his messages long enough to know, did he even tell you about his kid? Any of them?\n\nYeah his own biologically too. Talk about a shocker, he shares everything we thought, yet suddenly while drunk we found out his firsr wife and him had a secret partner who carried their child. \n\nIts like ela told him, he looks like the type to have multiple wives even if shes wrong about him being run through \n\nWhy? Why would he lie to us after we allowed him to stake our flesh marking us with scars not as property but our experiences. \n\nEven after our engagement he and his wife lie to me still. Pretending he cut you off when he did not. \n\nHe said he never wanted us to know for his families safety. Yet i find letters addressed to you where he explains it all and begs forgiveness. \n\nI will keep taking care of him, paying him and encouraging him to do what is needed. His children must be protected at any cost and if he thinks you were to threaten their innocence the way your people did to him. \n\nAnyways doll, ill see you soon but until then remember, that boy only broke my bones after months of my begging. \n\nI let him choose though and made sure he understood what i wanted, let him enjoy his time and sort through his trauma. \n\nNow i carry a lighthouse made from inflammation and scars, my bones still healing and my mind fixated on having him stable enough that he finally fufills his own desires, not what I or the other women want. \n\nYou should visit him, his wifes family bought a house with his money, a nice place that has some old police holding cells in it. \n\nPerfect for our filming and spending quality time. He wouldnt ever hurt you, trust me ive tried to show him how derranged his mindset is. Protecting his own abusers at his own detriment. \n\nRefusing to even confront you since he hopes to one day show you how wrong that was. \n\nThe fact he still tries to hide your identity. Hide what you did to him and gets so angry when we press him on why he would speak to your kind. \n\nHe never was good at protecting people sadly. He is far too trusting and willing to take risks he knows will result in him finding out how deep into hell he will be thrust by his own actions, still unable to see that he is walking with the divines grace.\n\n For an athiest like himself to still scorn religon yet study it fascinates me. It is like he understands what he is and just desires peace unaware he has made it for himself through years of blood. \n\nHe no longer needs to concern himself with your kind just like he no longer has to drive himself around. \n\nWe will take care of you and dont worry about the money you stole. I can make it back sevenfold with him through sacrificing my body, nails and chains holding up a board with his bourbon on it. \n\nIt is the only time he looks at me and i dont see the distractions in his mind. He has finally accepted who he is or so he claims. It does show though, he is more violent and affectionate with us all. \n\nHe deserves people like us who will protect him and make sure he sees people for who they are. \n\nHe still talks in his sleep, more often now that you are once again taking advantage of him.\n\n Apologizing to you a worthless whore in a panicked tone, yet when we ask about his dreams he always says he doesnt remember or it was the dream of being pursued and eating 762 ammunition shattering his teeth. \n\nIts funny we are literally his whores, he uses us and films us for our financial benifit. He lets us sleep with him in his own home, a new address in a new city he is paying for through sex.\n\nYet somehow, even though he lets us access his safes with enough money to rebuy his own childhood mansion and your families as well in cash, allows us to carry his automatics, nfs trusts with our names. \n\nHe still wont believe us when we tell him what needs to happen and what you are. \n\nThat you are a parasite that is intent on draining him and abusing him. Thankfully he is repulsed by your apperance now, i see it in his eyes and the comments he makes. How he always used to think you were attractive but now you are just playing pedo bait and look like a waterlogged corpse with how inflammed your face is. \n\nGods i really thought he was about to give us permission to travel west after that comment. Finally handle these issues like adults from his bloodline have for years. \n\nHe hates them all but you can see in his eyes his excitement. Such a tell that he speaks about MKUltra being an abuse of human rights then engages in our shared love language. \n\nI hope your family knows about your thefts. It would make it easier on them when it all catches up to you.  \n\nI will make you say his name and mine, all of ours before we are finished. He thinks he is so clever and able to hide his own suffering from us and its root cause. Its clear what we must do to resolve his pain. \n\nHis security system was a godsend. Being able to read your name off his phone when he messaged you to offer that help, well thank god he did it then sitting right in our garage under the cameras he set up. \n\nAs for me, i am going to be driving him 12 hours today then taking him back to columbia. He deserves the rest and excitement of being surrounded by us. Also i would be careful, his other partners are not as civilised as him and some have no love for him. \n\nThey will protect their investment without a care for his wishes or moral hangups. We all need people like that. \n",

In other words its just fucked. \n\nThe vehicle deck is set back a bit its still got a grip of 7 but also has 4 lands lost all its rocks and cost reduction. It could still be a threat\n\nGreen ramp over here lost his board but here is the difference... this fucker still has 12 lands. Its gonna cast 1 Big dude draw 8. Or its already drawn 8 on a previous turn so its grip is full already. \n\nAnd Timmy 2 braincells with his 5 lands and 3 cards is going \"yay we all even now we all have nothing its so fair that I used this symmetrical board wipe I wouldn't want to be asymmetrical cause that could be try hard\" (not exact words but something to that effect). No Timmy 2 braincells this was asymmetric. One person is way ahead of the table its just not you.\n\nPeople need to stop using board wipes to \"even the playing field\" It should advance your gameplan or effect you the least. Farewell all modes is amazing in planeswalker decks. If your gameplan is any of the modes you properly shouldn't be using it (especially if its graveyard related cause you get hit TWICE with the board and the graveyard).\n\nBut the thing is like the is no social positive way to address Timmy 2 braincells. Hence why im ranting after. \n\n",

He could talk throughout my whole 8 hour shift if possible. I don’t even know if he knows this can be annoying to others\n\nWhat kills me is he will talk to ME the whole time and barely his housemates. It ends up in me giving short responses because he keeps talking and making constant small talk and then going “ain’t that funny/crazy?” I can handle a group conversation but to have everyone talking AT me is really frustrating when I’m naturally quiet and it drains my energy. It’s getting to a point when I walk in at 7, I’m preparing myself for him and then as soon as he comes out of his room, I’m kind of annoyed\n\nHe’s emotionally needy!! Wherever I am, even though he’s blind, he will come find me and talk my ear off even if I moved to another room for a break. I try to get him to call his girlfriend so he’ll be distracted but no, he then keeps talking my ear off about her while he’s on the phone with her. Or me and the other guys will be watching a movie and he’ll go “oh, what movie is this?” And then immediately start talking about other things.\n\nToday I had enough when he was talking my ear off since he saw me come in, prepare breakfast, get cigarettes. I got up and went to another room and he eventually wandered in to chat and I told him I had to document. I didn’t have shit to document. I needed 20 minutes of silence. I had to insist for him to leave because he almost started going on another tangent!!\n\nBtw all my clients are independent and my supervisor encourages me to move to another room if I need a break or to let the men know that I need a breather ",

A club for the cool kids.\n\n---\n\nSo looking at the nobles of Edward II's generation (people who were political active during the reign of Edward II) at most, they would have been happy that they had survived.\n\nBut other than that, what had they gained?\n\nMost of them would have known people who got killed, friends or family members.\n\n\nThey had no glorious victories over foreign enemies. \n\nThey had spent most of their time fighting each other, internally.\n\nThe weather had been bad, causing famine.\nIt was shit.\n\nWhere was their glory and fun?!\n\n---\n\n\nIn comparison.\n\nEdward III proved himself to be a different kind of beast than his father.\n\nHe didnt have favorites, he was willing to listen and he loved everything the nobility liked.\n\nHe was a friendship magnet \n\n\nHe was everything the nobility could have hoped for..\n\n\n----\n\nSo imagine having survived the mess of Edward II's reign. And now you see this kid (Edward III) who is more or less everything you would want in a king.\n\nBut you are now past your prime. And it will be your kid who will stand beside Edward III.\n\nNot you....",

    "selftext": "Hi, after going back and forth with AI's multiple times, I'm done with the same responses again &amp; again. I need some real advice from people who've been through something like this\n\n\n\nThe whole thing kicked off in 5th grade when I got this massive crush on a girl in my class. I'd literally used to guess what she'd wear the next day so I could match my outfit. Yeah, I know, that's still dumb even for a kid that age\n\nAfter a while, my mom switched me to a different tuition, and we lost touch. But in the back of my mind, I always knew there was this girl I really liked, and someday I'd figure out how to approach her\n\nHer thought stayed with me all those years\n\nFast-forward to 10th grade: I join this new tuition center, look back at the batch, and uff, there she is. I recognize her instantly, like \"oh shit, it's her again.\" But our batches were on alternate days, so I'd only catch her sometimes. The crazy part? She recognized me too and came up to me first, asking if I was the guy she studied with back in childhood. That moment? My heart just melted\n\nWe'd talk occasionally, but fuck, fuck \\[Slamming the table RN\\], I was so much underconfident and shy back then, had no idea how to start or keep a conversation going, and I was stuck with this shitty keypad phone\n\nSince batches didn't overlap, no numbers exchanged or anything. We'd just see each other now and then, but any day I spotted her, even a quick glance made it the best part of my whole damn day  \nAnd those rare times we sat together? Don't even ask, every minute felt like I was whole, like being that close to her fixed everything. Her fragrance, her smile, even her presence was just ❤️,  \nI'd solve every problem in advance just so she could ask me when she got stuck\n\nAfter 10th grade, paths split, no contact at all.........\n\n\n\nCollege time: I took a year gap. Spent years casually searching for her online, finally found a profile with no pic, no DP, just a blurry photo. In my second year, I sent a short message and a LinkedIn request. She didn't accept or reply, so I thought, okay, one day I'll approach her face-to-face and start a real convo\n\nThen in my final year, I'm scrolling Reels and boom, she shows up on my feed. Damn, still as beautiful as ever, and all those childhood feelings reprised again. I realised the longer I delay the process, the more I'd lose my chance. She graduated a year ahead from [B.Tech](http://b.tech/) bcoz of my gap and jumped into a B-tier business school for her MBA right after.\n\n**Here's where my real problem starts**: I got way too aggressive searching for her everywhere, found her number, joined some common WhatsApp groups. Don't ask how it escalated, not going into details, but it did. Before I could even try talking to her in person, she blocked me on LinkedIn. That hit me hard, like really, really heartbreaking...  \nBut after putting so much mind in my situation, I realised I love her very much &amp; can't give up on her after this... I still think there is some hope\n\nShe's just started her 2-year MBA this year; I'm graduating next year, so she'll finish in 2027.\n\n**Quick context on me**: I'm in a below-Tier-1 college doing [B.Tech](http://b.tech/), but when it comes to coding, I'm better than anyone in my batch &amp; secured the highest-paid internship in my 3rd yr. I'm so confident that by the end of next year, I'll surely land a $100K (₹90 lakhs INR) remote software engineer role; there is no doubt in that. I get compliments on my looks sometimes, have a decent physique, but I'm grinding every day &amp; I think if i continue my progress then in the next 4-5 months I will consider myself jacked. No offence to her, but from her profile, she is not doing great in her career, average internships, and also her MBA school's median/avg package is under ₹7 LPA (\\~$8K)\n\nI still have this huge crush on her, like massive. But approaching her directly now? I'd come off as nothing less than a creep after the block. So the only option I am left is to wait till I lock in that package (max 7-8 months), then go straight for an arranged marriage proposal through our families.\n\n**In my head, every girl wants a guy who's got his life together and is successful, right? So when I approach her family, they'll see this dude who's doing good career-wise, jacked, had an amazing career trajectory, decently handsome, young, no smoking or drinking, from the same community, comes from an upper-middle-class family &amp; genuinely loves their daughter**\n\nBut the main thing which I am too concerned about is the block. I think her family will be impressed, but I don't know about her, like how she will react\n\n* like Ohh this person is amazing or doing well in his life, I should marry him\n* Outright reject me, thinking that he is still a creep, still approaching me after the block, on social media it was ok, but now directly asking for marriage\n* Would consider about proposal, but had this thing in her back of her mind, like WHY ? even after a block &amp; now this time for marriage I don't know, I just need advice &amp; my mind is always going in that direction of will she accept the proposal or not, because even though I am doing this all for myself, but her thought's are acting like a fuel for me, one moment I'm thinking, If I did good in my career, then I will became a no brainer for her, but also this thing comes to mind, like what if I'm doing this much &amp; would also get a good package, what If ? she still rejects me? what if she already had someone in her life? But then I calm myself by thinking that most relationships don't survive after college, I'm trying to do my work thinking I'm doing this all for myself, but again &amp; again her thought comes to mind, like if I did good, I will get her, but what if she rejects? what if she had someone in her own life?\n\nI don't know, man, I just need advice. My brain won't stop looping on \"will she say yes or not?\", I don't want to keep any regrets by not approaching her, but this uncertainty is killing me from inside\n\nI explained whole situation to you. C**an anybody here tell me what do you think she will accept my proposal or not** ? What do you think about this overall situation ?\n\n**tl;dr**:  \nBeen crushing hard on this girl since 5th grade (same community), reconnected quickly in 10th but I was too shy/awkward to make moves, no real contact after.  \n**College**: Tracked her down, sent LinkedIn msg/request (ignored), got overeager searching (found number, groups), ended up blocked before face-to-face (my fuck-up, crushed me deeply)  \nNow 22M in [B.Tech](http://b.tech/) (top coder, highest internship, locking $100K remote job in 7-8 months, building jacked physique, good looks, clean/no habits, solid upper-middle family) vs. her 23F fresh in B-tier MBA (avg internships, MBA school avg. package \\~₹7LPA)  \n**Plan**: Post-job, family-arranged marriage proposal (highlight success, shared roots, deep feelings). Block worries me tho, family might love it, but will she see glow-up and think \"**damn, amazing potential**\" or just \"**persistent creep**, **hard pass**\"? really want to know my odds of her accepting my marriage proposal or not? How to kill the \"what if she rejects/already in a relationship with someone\" spiral and stay locked in on my grind?\n\n",

You have to think about using your abilities wisely and strategically before acting.\n\nAbilities (and keys to use):\n** Melee Attack (M1):**\n 1.1 second cooldown Melee Attack - he strikes or scratches the survivor. Deals 47 damage.\n\n**Sabotage (M):**\n 22-second cooldown. With a 1.5-second delay, DOCT0R NOSO1 will roar, and nearby survivors will have a fog obscuring their vision for 5 seconds and will be unable to use their abilities for 9 seconds.\n\n**Trapped (Q):**\n 18-second cooldown. Near him, tall rocks will rise from the ground around him and remain for 5 seconds, then quickly break apart on their own. DOCT0R NOSO1 can exit whenever he wants by passing through the rocks, but the trapped survivor cannot exit until the rocks break.\n\n**Nosoi Trick (X):**\n 18-second cooldown. DOCT0R NOSO1 will have -5 speed reduction on his running speed for 2.5 seconds. The survivor who stuns him with the ability will have the following effects: DOCT0R NOSO1's stun will be negated.\n\nAfter 3 seconds, DOCT0R NOSO1 will fly alone at high speed (99 speed) to the survivor (he can pass through walls if the Stun is long-range on his own) who stunned him 3 seconds ago and will deliver a blow that will deal 35 damage, and DOCT0R NOSO1 will return at normal speed and go to exactly where he delivered the blow. (There is no way to escape this ability after it has been Stunned, only Knuckles' Counter or Eggman's Electric Shield).\n\n**Trap and Spread (Z):**\n 25-second cooldown. A small yellow flower will appear exactly where the survivors were, and DOCTOR NOSO1 will be able to see the survivors moving through the red walls for 5 seconds. If DOCTOR NOSO1 presses Z again, the survivors will teleport to where each survivor's flower was.\n\n(You can use it the first time, when the flower appears, and the second time when the teleport occurs; after that, the cooldown returns to normal and you can do it again.\n\n**Minilore:**\nDoct0r Nosoi1 came from a different dimension than 2011X. 2011X had been killed by Super Sonic, and Doctor Nosoi1 was 2011X's best friend from that dimension. He became angry; he was peaceful, but his anger blinded him, and he wanted to eliminate all the survivors from every dimension.\n\n**On a scale of 1 to 10, what rak would you give him?**",
